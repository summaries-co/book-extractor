Salim has studied and interviewed CEOs and\nentrepreneurs whose companies are leveraging a newly available set of\nexternalities and, as a result, scaling their organizations at many times the\nnormal rate of typical companies. More important, he’s thought deeply about\nand analyzed how existing organizations need to adapt. For this reason, I\ncan’t think of a more perfect guide to those CEOs and executives interested\nin thriving during this time of disruptive change.\nHave no doubt, Expone ntial Organizations: Why New Organizations\nare Ten Times Better, Faster and Cheaper Than Yours (And What To Do\nAbout It) is both a roadmap and a survival guide for the CEO, the\nentrepreneur and, most of all, the executive of the future. Congratulations on\nthe successes that got you to this point in your career, but let me forewarn you\nthat those skills are already out of date. The concepts in this book and the\nconversations that they spark are the new lingua franca for anyone wanting\nto remain competitive and stay in the game. In today’s corporate world there\nis a new breed of institutional organism—the Exponential Organization—\nloose on Earth, and if you don’t understand it, prepare for it and, ultimately,\nbecome it, you will be disrupted.",

        "contents": "The concept of the Exponential Organization (ExO) first arose at\nSingularity University, which I co-founded in 2008 with noted futurist,\nauthor, entrepreneur-turned-AI director at Google, Ray Kurzweil. The goal\nwas to create a new kind of university, one whose curriculum was constantly\nbeing updated. For that reason SU was never accredited—n ot because we\ndidn’t care, but because the curriculum was changing too fast. SU would\nfocus only on the exponentially growing (or accelerating technologies) that\nwere riding on the back of Moore’s Law. Areas like infinite computing,\nsensors, networks, artificial intelligence, robotics, digital manufacturing,\nsynthetic biology, digital medicine and nanomaterials. By design and desire,\nour students would be the world’s top entrepreneurs, as well as executives\nfrom Fortune 500 companies. Our mission: to help people positively impact\nthe lives of a billion people.\nThe idea for SU came together at a Founding Conference hosted at\nNASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley in September 2008. What I\nremember most clearly from the event was an impromptu speech given by\nGoogle co-founder Larry Page near the end of the first day. Standing before\nabout one hundred attendees, Page made an impassioned speech calling for\nthis new university to focus on addressing the world’s biggest problems: “I\nnow have a very simple metric I use: Are you working on something that can\nchange the world? Yes or no? The answer for 99.99999 percent of people is\n‘no.’ I think we need to be training people on how to change the world.\nObviously, technologies are the way to do that. That’s what we’ve seen in the\npast; that’s what’s driven all the change.”\nOne of the individuals in the audience listening to Page was Salim, who\nhad headed up Brickhouse, Yahoo’s intrapreneurial incubator. He, too, was\ntaken by that message, and within weeks, he joined Singularity as the\nuniversity’s founding Executive Director. Salim, having run several startupsbefore, navigated the usual crises that come with an early stage company and\nplayed a crucial role in making SU the success it is today. But perhaps most\nimportant of all, Salim pulled together the diverse thoughts and case studies\ntaught at SU and wove them together into a vision for a new kind of company,\none that operated at ten times the price performance of those just a decade\nago.\nIt was my pleasure to help frame the attributes, concepts and practices\nexhibited by Exponential Organizations, and to join Salim, Yuri van Geest,\nand Mike Malone in developing this book . Together, we have had the great\nfortune to study and understand how accelerating technologies are changing\nthe course of nations, industry and all of humanity, and to manifest Salim’s\n“how-to guide” for the Exponential Executive. Some of the work described\nin the chapters ahead emerged from my own book , Abundanc e: The Future Is\nBetter Than You Think (co-authored with Steven Kotler), as a framing of\nwhere we all could end up, but most of it applies to the companies of today\nand how they need to navigate there.\nSalim’s co-authors also deserve recognition. First is Yuri van Geest, a\nSingularity University graduate and one of the world’s leading experts in\nmobile, as well as a keen student of exponential technologies and trends.\nYuri has a background in organizational design and has been materially\ninvolved since early on in the project. Second is veteran high-technology\njournalist Mike Malone. Mike is not only a world-class technology reporter,\nbut also the inventor of two influential organizational models that preceded\nthis book : the Virtual Corporation (with Bill Davidow) and the Protean\nOrganization.\nSalim’s vision of the Exponential Organization is a powerful one. Potent\nforces are emerging in the world—e xponential technologies, the DIY\ninnovator, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and the rising billion—that willgive us the power to solve many of the world’s grandest challenges and the\npotential to meet the needs of every man, women and child over the next two\nto three decades. These same forces are now empowering smaller and\nsmaller teams to do what was once only possible via governments and the\nlargest corporations.\nThree billion new minds will join the global economy over the next half-\ndozen years. The relevance of this is twofold. First, these three billion\npeople represent a new popu lation of consumers who have never bought\nanything before. Consequentially, they represent a long tail of tens-of-\ntrillions of dollars of emerging buying power. If they are not your direct\ncustomers, fear not; they are likely your customer’s customers. Second, this\ngroup—the “rising billion”—is a new entrepreneurial class powered with\nthe latest generation of Internet-delivered technologies—everything from\nGoogle and Artificial Intelligence, to 3D printing and synthetic biology. As\nsuch, we will see an explosion in the rate of innovation, as millions of new\ninnovators begin to experiment and upload their products and services and\nlaunch new businesses. If you think the rate of innovation has been fast in\nrecent years, let me be among the first to tell you: you haven’t seen anything\nyet.\nToday the only constant is change, and the rate of change is increasing.\nYour competition is no longer the multinational corporation overseas, it’s\nnow the guy or gal in the Silicon Valley or Bandra (Mumbai) garage using the\nlatest online tools to design and cloud print their latest innovation.\nBut the question remains: how can you harness all of this creative\npower? How can you construct an enterprise that is as quick, adept and\ninnovative as the people who will be part of it? How will you compete in\nthis accelerated new world? How will you organize to scale?\nThe answer is the Exponential Organization.You won’t have much choice, because in many (and soon most) industries,\nthat acceleration is already underway. Lately, I’ve begun to teach about what\nI call the 6Ds: Digitized, Deceptive, Disruptive, Dematerialize, Demonetize\nand Democratize.\nAny technology that becomes Digitized (our first “D”) enters a period of\nDeceptive growth. During the early period of exponentials, the doubling of\nsmall numbers (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08)  all basically looks like zero. But once\nits hits the knee of the curve, you are only ten doublings away from 1,000x ,\ntwenty doublings get you to 1,000,000x , and thirty doublings get you a\n1,000,000,000x  increase.\nSuch a rapid rise describes the third D, Disruptive. And, as you shall see\nin the pages of this book , once a technology become disruptive it\nDematerializes—which means that you no longer physically carry around a\nGPS, video camera or flashlight. All of them have dematerialized as apps\nonto your smartphone. And once that happens, the product or service\nDemonetizes. Thus, Uber is demonetizing taxi fleets and Craigslist\ndemonetized the classified ads (taking down a flock of newspapers in the\nprocess).\nThe final step to all this is Democratization. Thirty years ago if you\nwanted to reach a billion people, you needed to be Coca-Cola or GE, with\nemployees in one hundred countries. Today you can be a kid in a garage who\nuploads an app onto a few key platforms. Your ability to touch humanity has\nbeen democratized.\nWhat Salim and the team have observed from the front lines—and what\nyou will come to understand as you read this book —is that no current\ncommercial, governmental or non-profit enterprise, as currently configured,\ncan keep up with the pace that will be set by these 6Ds. To do s o will require\nsomething radically new—a new vision of organization that is astechnologically smart, adaptive and encompassing (not just of employees but\nof billions of people in vast social networks) as the new world in which it\nwill operate—and ultimately transform.\nThat vision is the Exponential Organization.\nPeter H.

In fact, the satellite system was doom ed before it was\neven put in place, one of the most dramatic victims of technological\ninnovation.There were several reasons behind Iridium’s failure. Even as the company\nwas launching its satellites, the cost of installing cell phone towers was\ndropping, network speeds were increasing by orders of magnitude, and\nhandsets were shrinking in both size and price. To be fair, Iridium was hardly\nalone in its misjudgment. Competitors Odyssey and Globalstar both made the\nsame fundamental mistake. Ultimately, in fact, more than $10 billion in\ninvestor money was lost in a misplaced bet that the pace of technological\nchange was too slow to keep up with market demand.\nOne reason for this debacle, according to Dan Colussy, who drove\nIridium’s buyout in 2000, was the company’s refusal to update business\nassumptions. “The Iridium business plan was locked in place twelve years\nbefore the system became operational,” he recalls. That’s a long time, long\nenough that it was almost impossible to predict where the state of the art in\ndigital communications would be by the time the satellite system was at last in\nplace. We thus label this an Iridium Moment—using linear tools and the\ntrends of the past to predict an accelerating future.\nAnother Iridium Moment is the well-documented case of Eastman Kodak,\nwhich declared bankruptcy in 2012 after having invented, and then rejected,\nthe digital camera. At around the same time Kodak was closing its doors, the\nstartup Instagram, three years in business and with just thirteen employees,\nwas bought by Facebook  for $1 billion. (Ironically, this happened while\nKodak still owned the patents for digital photography.)\nIridium’s missteps and the epochal industry change from Kodak to Instagram\nwere not isolated events. Competition for many of America’s Fortune 500\ncompanies is no longer coming from China and India. As Peter Diamandis hasnoted, today it’s increasingly coming from two guys in a garage with a startup\nleveraging exponentially growing technologies. YouTube went from a startup\nfunded by Chad Hurley’s personal credit cards to being purchased by Google\nfor $1.4 billion, all in less than eighteen months. Groupon leapt from\nconception to $6 billion in value in less than two years. Uber is valued at\nalmost $17 billion, ten times its value of just two years ago. What we’re\nwitnessing is a new breed of organization that is scaling and generating value\nat a pace never before seen in business. The chart below shows the\naccelerating metabolism of the economy.\nWelcome to the new world of the Expone ntial Organization, or ExO.

On the other hand,\nit is also a place where if you can build an organization that is sufficiently\nscalable, fast moving and smart, you may enjoy success—exponential success\n—to a degree never before possible. And all with a minimum of resources\nand time.\nWe have entered the age of the billion-dollar startup and soon, the trillion-\ndollar corporation, where the best companies and institutions will be moving\nat seemingly light speed. If you haven’t transitioned into an Exponential\nOrganization as well, it will not only seem as though your competition is\nracing away from you, but also, like Kodak, that you are sliding backwards at\nbreakneck speed into obl ivion.\nIn 2011, Babson’s Olin Graduate School of Business predicted that in ten\nyears, 40 percent of existing Fortune 500 Companies would no longer\nsurvive. Richard Foster of Yale University estimates that the average lifespan\nof an S&P 500 company has decreased from sixty-seven years in the 1920s  to\nfifteen years today. And that lifespan is going to get even shorter in the years\nto come as these giant corporations aren’t just forced to compete with, but are\nannihilated—s eemingly overnight—by  a new breed of companies that\nharnesses the power of exponential technologies, from groupware and data\nmining to synthetic biology and robotics. And as the rise of Google portents,\nthe founders of those new companies will become the leaders of the world’s\neconomy for the foreseeable future.\nDoubling Down\nFor most of recorded history, a community’s productivity was a function\nof its human power: men and women to hunt, gather and build, and children toassist. Double the number of hands gathering crops or bringing home meat and\nthe community doubled its output.\nIn time, humanity domesticated beasts of burden, including the horse and\nox, and output increased further. But the equation was still linear. Double the\nbeasts, dou ble the output.\nAs market capitalism came into existence and the industrial age dawned,\noutput took a huge leap. Now a single individual could operate machinery that\ndid the work of 10 horses or 100 laborers. The speed of transport, and thus\ndistribution, dou bled, and then, for the first time in human history, tripled.\nIncreased output brought prosperity to many and, ultimately, a manifold\njump in the standard of living. Starting at the end of the eighteenth century and\ncontinuing through the present—and largely the result of the intersection of the\nIndustrial Revolution and the modern scientific research laboratory—mankind\nhas witnessed a doubling of the human lifespan and a tripling of inflation-\nadjusted per capita net worth for every nation on Earth.\nDuring this most recent phase of human productivity, the limiting factor to\ngrowth has shifted from the number of bodies (human or animal) to the number\nof machines and the capital expense deployed. Doubling the number of\nfactories meant twice the output. Companies have grown ever larger, and they\nnow span the globe. With size has come increased global reach, the potential\nfor sector dom ination and, ultimately, enduring and hugely lucrative success.\nBut such growth takes time and typically has required enormous capital\ninvestment. None of this comes cheap, and the complexity of large-scale\nhiring efforts and the difficulties of designing, building and delivering new\nequipment means that implementation timelines are still measured over the\nbetter part of a decade. On more than one occasion, CEOs and boards of\ndirectors have found themselves (as did Iridium) “betting the company” on a\nnew direction requiring a huge capital investment measured in hundreds of\nmillions or billions of dollars.

        "contents": "companies, automotive companies and energy companies routinely find\nthemselves making investments whose returns might not be known for many\nyears.\nAlthough a workable system, it is far from an optimal one. Too much\nmoney and valuable talent is locked up in decade-long projects whose\nlikelihood of success can’t be measured almost until the moment they fail. All\nof which adds up to enormous waste, not least in terms of lost potential to\npursue other ideas and oppor tunities that could benefit mankind.\nThis is neither a tenable nor an acceptable situation, especially when the\nchallenges that face mankind in the twenty-first century will take every bit of\nthe imagination and innovation we can muster.\nThere must be a better way to organize ourselves. We’ve learned how to\nscale technology; now it’s time we learned how to scale organizations. This\nnew age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving\nrates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead.\nThat solution is the Exponential Organization.\nExponential Organizations\nLet’s begin with a definition:\nAn Exponential Organization (ExO) is one whose impact (or\noutput) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—\ncompared to its peers because of the use of new\norganizational techniques that leverage accelerating\ntechnologies.Rather than using armies of people or large physical plants, Exponential\nOrganizations are built upon information technologies that take what was once\nphysical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.\nEverywhere you look you see this digital transformation taking place: In\n2012, 93 percent of U.S. transactions were already digital; physical\nequipment companies like Nikon are seeing their cameras rapidly being\nsupplanted by the cameras on smartphones; map and atlas makers were\nreplaced by Magellan GPS systems, which themselves were replaced by\nsmartphone sensors; and libraries of book s and music have been turned into\nphone and e-reader apps. Similarly, retail stores in China are being replaced\nby the rise of e-commerce tech giant Alibaba, universities are being\nthreatened by MOOCs such as edX and Coursera, and the Tesla S is more a\ncomputer with wheels than it is a car.\nThe sixty-year history of Moore’s Law—ba sically, that the price/performance\nof computation will double about every eighteen months—has been well\ndocumented. And we’ve come a long way since 1971, when the original\ncircuit board held just two hundred chips; today we have teraflops of\ncomputing operating within the same physical space.\nThat steady, extraordinary, and seemingly impossible pace led futurist Ray\nKurzweil, who has studied this phenomenon for thirty years, to make four\nsignature observations:\nFirst, the doubling pattern identified by Gordon Moore in integrated\ncircuits applies to any information technology. Kurzweil calls this the\nLaw of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) and shows that doubling patterns\nin computation extend all the way back to 1900, far earlier than Moore’s\noriginal pronouncement.Second, the driver fueling this phenomenon is information. Once any\ndomain, discipline, technology or industry becomes information-enabled\nand powered by information flows, its price/performance begins\ndoubling approximately annually.\nThird, once that doubling pattern starts, it doesn’t stop. We use current\ncomputers to design faster computers, which then build faster computers,\nand so on.\nFinally, several key technologies today are now information-enabled and\nfollowing the same trajectory. Those technologies include artificial\nintelligence (AI), robotics, biotech and bioinformatics, medicine,\nneuroscience, data science, 3D printing, nanotechnology and even\naspects of energy.\nNever in human history have we seen so many technologies moving at\nsuch a pace. And now that we are information-enabling everything around us,\nthe effects of the Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns are sure to be\nprofound.\nWhat’s more, as these technologies intersect (e.g., using deep-learning AI\nalgorithms to analyze cancer trials), the pace of innovation accelerates even\nfurther. Each intersection adds yet another multiplier to the equation.\nArchimedes once said, “Give me a lever long enough, and I’ll move the\nworld.” Simply put, mankind has never had a bigger lever.Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns and Moore’s Law long ago broke\nfrom the confines of semiconductors and have utterly transformed human\nsociety over the last fifty years. Now, Exponential Organizations, the latest\nembodiment of acceleration in human culture and enterprise, are overhauling\ncommerce and other aspects of modern life, and at a scorching pace that will\nquickly leave the old world of “linear organizations” far behind. Those\nenterprises that don’t jump aboard soon will be left on the ash heap of history,\njoining Iridium, Kodak, Polaroid, Philco, Blockbuster, Nokia and a host of\nother once-great, industry-dominant corporations unable to adapt to rapid\ntechnological change.In the pages ahead, we will outline the key internal and external attributes of\nan Exponential Organization, including its design (or lack thereof), lines of\ncommunication, decision-making protocol, information infrastructure,\nmanagement, philosophy and life cycle. We will explore how an ExO differs\nin terms of strategy, structure, culture, processes, operations, systems, people\nand key performance indicators. We will also discuss the crucial importance\nof a company having what we call a Massive Transformative Purpose (a term\nwe will define in depth). We will then look at how to launch an ExO startup,\nhow to adopt ExO practices in mid-cap companies and how to retrofit them to\nlarge organizations.\nOur objective is to not make this a book  of theory, but rather to present the\nreader with a how-to guide to the creation and maintenance of an Exponential\nOrganization. We offer a hands-on, prescriptive look at how to organize an\nenterprise able to compete in the face of today’s accelerated pace of change.\nAlthough many of the ideas we will present may seem radically new, they\nhave been around, sub rosa, for a decade or more. We first identified the ExO\nparadigm as a weak signal in 2009, and noticed over a two-year period that\nseveral new organizations were following a specific model. In 2011, futurist\nPaul Saffo suggested to Salim that he write this book , and we have been\nseriously researching the ExO model for the last three years. To do s o, we:\nReviewed sixty classic innovation management book s by such authors as\nJohn Hagel, Clayton Christensen, Eric Ries, Gary Hamel, Jim Collins,\nW. Chan Kim, Reid Hoffman and Michael Cusumano.\nInterviewed C-Level executives from several dozen Fortune 200\ncompanies with our survey and frameworks.Interviewed or researched ninety top entrepreneurs and visionaries\nincluding Marc Andreessen, Steve Forbes, Chris Anderson, Michael\nMilken, Paul Saffo, Philip Rosedale, Arianna Huffington, Tim O’Reilly\nand Steve Jurvetson.\nInvestigated the characteristics of the one hundred fastest growing and\nmost successful startups across the world, including those that comprise\nthe Unicorn Club (Aileen Lee’s name for the billion-dollar market cap\nstartup group), to tease out commonalities the companies used to scale.\nReviewed presentations and gleaned key insights from core faculty\nmembers at Singularity University regarding the acceleration they are\nseeing at the edges of their fields and how that acceleration might impact\norganizational design.\nWe don’t claim to have all the answers. But based upon our own\nexperiences, both good and bad, we believe we can offer management teams\ncritical insight into this era of hyper-accelerated innovation and competition,\nas well as into the new oppor tunities (and responsibilities) presented by this\nnew world. If we can’t guarantee you success, we can at least put you on the\nright playing field and show you the new rules of the game.

In fact, by 2000, there\nwere one hundred million mobile phones. Not only was McKinsey’s\nprediction off by 99 percent, its recommendation also resulted in AT&T\nmissing out on one of the biggest business oppor tunities of modern times.\nIn 2009 , yet another major market research firm, the Gartner Group,\nforecast that by 2012 Symbian would be the top operating system for mobile\ndevices, with a 39 percent market share and two hundred three million units\nshipped—a  leadership position Gartner anticipated the company would hold\nthrough 2014. Gartner also predicted in the same report that Android would\nhold just a 14.5 pe rcent market share.\nThe reality? Symbian shut its doors at the end of 2012 after shipping only\n2.2 million units in Q4. Android, on the other hand, has overtaken even the\nApple iPhone OS and today dominates the mobile world, with over one\nbillion Android OS shipments just in 2014.",

        "contents": "Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla conducted an insightful piece of research\nin which he reviewed predictions made by mobile phone industry analysts\nfrom 2000 to 2010. He studied major research firms such as Gartner,\nForrester, McKinsey and Jupiter to see how they predicted the growth of the\nmobile phone industry in two-year increments over the course of that decade.\nKhosla’s research showed that in 2002 experts predicted, on average, 16\npercent year-to-year growth. In fact, by 2004, the industry had seen a 100\npercent increase. In 2004, their collective predictions called for an increase\nof 14 percent; by 2006, growth had once again climbed 100 percent. In 2006,\nthe analysts estimated sales would increase just 12 percent—and they\ndoubled again. Despite three previous—and notable—failures, in 2008 these\nvery same experts forecast a measly 10 percent growth, only to see the\nnumber double yet again—another 100 percent leap. It is hard to imagine\nhow anyone could be more wrong than to be off by 10x—and yet these were\nthe mobile phone industry experts upon whom corporations and governments\nworldwide relied for their long-term strategic planning. Nowhere does the\nphrase “missed by a country mile” seem more appropriate.\nWhat makes this failure valuable for our purposes is that at each point of\nexpone ntial growth in mobile phones over the last decade, the world’s top\nprognosticators predicted largely linear change. Again, we would label it\nIridium thinking.\nKhosla’s research proved particularly compelling and valuable when he\nwent on to show that such prediction errors weren’t unique just to the mobile\nphone industry, but also to the oil industry and a host of other sectors. It\nseemed that, when facing exponential growth, the experts in almost every\nfield always projected linearly, despite the evidence before their eyes.\nBrough Turner, a noted entrepreneur in VOIP and mobile telephony, has\nbeen building companies in that industry since 1990. Having kept close trackof industry predictions since the early 90s, he concurs with Khosla’s\nanalysis. In a recent interview with Salim, Turner noted that while the initial\nprojections were always aggressive, the experts inevitably expected a\ntapering after the first eighteen to twenty-four months. Nonetheless, he said,\nthe same rates of growth continued for twenty years. David Frigstad, CEO of\nresearch firm Frost & Sullivan, explains at least part of the problem thusly:\n“Predicting a technology when it’s doubling is inherently tricky. If you miss\none step, you’re off by 50 pe rcent!”\nA final example should drive the point home. In 1990, the Human\nGenome Project was launched with the aim of fully sequencing a single\nhuman genome. Estimates called for the project to take fifteen years and cost\nabout $6 billion. In 1997, however, halfway through the estimated time\nframe, just 1 percent of the human genome had been sequenced. Every expert\nlabeled the project a failure, pointing out that at seven years for just 1\npercent, it would take seven hundred years to finish the sequencing. Craig\nVenter, one of the principal researchers, received calls from friends and\ncolleagues imploring him to stop the project and not embarrass himself\nfurther. “Save your career,” he recalls them saying. “Return the money.”\nWhen Ray Kurzweil was asked his perspective, however, his view of the\n“impending disaster” was quite different. “1 percent,” he said. “That means\nwe’re halfway done.” What Kurzweil got that no one else did was that the\namount sequenced was doubling every year. 1 percent doubling seven times\nis 100 percent. Kurzweil’s math was correct, and in fact the project was\ncompleted in 2001, e arly and under budget. The so-called experts had missed\nthe end poi nt by 696 y ears.\nWhat is going on here? How can intelligent and well-read analysts,\nentrepreneurs and investors so consistently get things wrong? And not just a\nlittle wrong, but wrong by as much as 99 pe rcent?If such predictions had been just a little bit off, it would be easy to\ndismiss them as based on bad data, or even simple incompetence. But no,\nmistakes this great are almost always due to a complete misinterpretation of\nthe rules defining the nature of the marketplace. They come from relying on a\nparadigm that performed perfectly up until the moment it didn’t, and that is\nsuddenly, often inexplicably, out of date.\nBut if there is a new paradigm assuming a central role in the modern\neconomy, one that will define how we live and work, what is it?\nThe answer lies within the anecdotes cited in the introduction to this\nbook . Consider, for example, the Eastman Kodak story. Was its failure simply\na case of a once-great company that had grown complacent and lost its\ninnovative edge, as was suggested by the media at the time? Or was there\nsomething larger at work?\nThink back, if you are old enough to remember, to the days of film\nphotography. Each photograph cost an incremental amount of money. The cost\nof the film, the cost of mailing or hand-delivering the film, the cost of\nprocessing that film—in the end, it all added up to about a dollar per\nphotograph. Photography was based upon a scarcity model and we carefully\nconserved and managed our photos and film rolls to ensure no wasted shots.\nWith the shift to digital photography, something important—indeed\nsomething revolutionary—happened. The marginal cost of taking an extra\nphotograph didn’t just diminish, as it would with a linear improvement in the\ntechnology; instead, it essentially sank to zero. It didn’t matter if you took\nfive pictures or five hundred. The cost was the same. Eventually, even the\nstorage of the photos themselves became all but free.And that wasn’t the only technological leap. Once you had these digital\nphotographs, you could apply computations to them in the form of image\nrecognition, artificial intelligence, social technologies, filtering, editing, and\nmachine learning. Now anyone with minimal training could become a\n“darkroom wizard” like Edward Weston or Ansel Adams. You could also\nmanipulate, move and copy a digital photograph infinitely more quickly and\neasily than a physical one—and as such you became a publisher as well as a\nprint and wire service. And all these things could be done with a camera that\nwas a fraction the cost and size of the traditional analog versions it replaced.\nIn other words, what happened in the world of photography wasn’t just a\nmajor improvement. It wasn’t even just a single evolutionary leap. Eastman\nKodak might have managed to stay competitive had that been the only\nchallenge. But Kodak (and Polaroid, among other giants in the field) was hit\nby revolutionary technological change coming at it from multiple directions:\ncameras, film, processing, distribution, retailing, marketing, packaging,\nstorage and, ultimately and most decisively, a radical change in the\nperceptions of the marketplace.\nThat is the very definition of a paradigm shift. There’s an important and\nfoundational lesson illustrated in each of these anecdotes, which is that an\ninformation-based environment delivers fundam entally disruptive\noppor tunities.\nThere are thousands of similar disruptions taking place across the global\neconomy, where just such a profound shift is occurring from a physical\nsubstrate to an information substrate. That is, at the heart of every one of\nthese disruptions—these evolutionary leaps—can be found a fundamental\nchange in the role of information: semiconductor chips assuming the role of\nimage capture, display, storage and controller; the Internet transforming\nsupply, distribution and retail channels; and social networks and groupwarereorganizing institutions. Together, all indications are that we are shifting to\nan information-based par adigm.\nIn his book The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,\nKurzweil identified a hugely important and fundamental property of\ntechnology: when you shift to an information-based environment, the pace of\ndevelopment jumps onto an exponential growth path and price/performance\ndoubles every year or two.\nAs everyone in technology knows, this pace of change was first\ndiscovered and described in 1964 by Intel Corporation co-founder Gordon\nMoore. His discovery, immortalized as Moore’s Law, has seen the doubling\nof price/performance in computing continue uninterrupted for a half-century.\nAs noted in the Introduction, Kurzweil took Moore’s Law several steps\nfurther, noting that every information-based paradigm operates in the same\nway, something he called the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR).\nThere is a growing recognition that the pace of change formerly seen in\ncomputing is now mapping into other technologies with the same effect. For\nexample, the first human genome was sequenced in 2000 at a cost of $2.7\nbillion. Because of the underlying accelerations in computing, sensors and\nnew measurement techniques, the cost of DNA sequencing has been moving\nat five times the pace of Moore’s Law. In 2011, Dr. Moore had his own\ngenome sequenced for $100,00 0. Today that very same sequencing costs\nabout $1,000, a figure that is expected to drop to $100 by 2015, and to just a\npenny by 2020, when, in the words of Raymond McCauley, “It will soon be\ncheaper to sequence your genome…than it will be to flush your toilet.”\nWe’ve seen a similar movement in robotics. Those twenty dollar toy\nhelicopters all the kids are playing with? Five years ago that capability cost\n$700. Eight years ago it didn’t even exist. As former astronaut Dan Barry\nsays of a toy drone helicopter available on Amazon for seventeen dollars, “Ithas a gyro in it that space shuttle engineers would have spent $100 million to\nhave thirty years ago.”\nAnd that’s just biotech and robotics. We are also seeing plummeting costs\nacross a host of other technologies, including the following:\n3D printing\nCost (averages) for equivalent functionality: $40,000\n(2007)  to $100 ( 2014)\nScale: 400x  in 7 years\nIndustrial robots\nCost: $500,000 ( 2008)  to $22,000 ( 2013)\nScale: 23x in 5 years\nDrones\nCost: $100,000 ( 2007)  to $700 ( 2013)\nScale: 142x  in 6 years\nSolar\nCost: $30 pe r kWh (1984)  to $0.16 pe r kWh (2014)\nScale: 200x  in 20 y ears\nSensors (3D LIDAR sensor)\nCost: $20,000 ( 2009)  to $79 ( 2014)\nScale: 250x  in 5 years\nBiotech (DNA sequencing of one whole human DNA profile)\nCost: $10 m illion (2007)  to $1,000 ( 2014)Scale: 10,000x  in 7 years\nNeurotech (BCI devices)\nCost: $4,000 ( 2006)  to $90 ( 2011)\nScale: 44x in 5 years\nMedicine (full body  scan)\nCost: $10,000 ( 2000)  to $500 ( 2014)\nScale: 20x in 14 y ears\nIn each of these domains, at least one aspect is being information-\nenabled, which then catapults it onto the bullet train of Moore’s Law as the\npace of development accelerates into a doubling pattern.\nThe physical world is still there, of course, but our relationship to it is\nchanging fundamentally. Note that for many of us, our memories aren’t in our\nheads anymore—they’re buried in our smartphones. Via social networks, our\nrelationships are increasingly digital, not analog, and our communication is\nnearly all-digital. We are rapidly changing the filter through which we deal\nwith the world from a physical, materially-based perspective to an\ninformation- and knowledge-based one.\nAnd this is just beginning. Ten years ago we had five hundred million\nInternet-connected devices. Today there are about eight billion. By 2020\nthere will be fifty billion and a decade later we’ll have a trillion Internet-\nconnected devices as we literally information-enable every aspect of the\nworld in the Internet of Things. The Internet is now the world’s nervous\nsystem, with our mobile devices serving as edge points and nodes on that\nnetwork.\nThink about that for a second: we’ll be jumping from eight billion\nInternet-connected devices today to fifty billion by 2025, and to a trillion amere decade later. We like to think that thirty or forty years into the\nInformation Revolution we are well along in terms of its development. But\naccording to this metric, we’re just 1 percent of the way down the road. Not\nonly is most of that growth still ahead of us, all of it is.\nAnd everything is being disrupted in the process.\nThe magnitude of that disruption, especially in the consumer world, is\nonly now becoming obvious. It started with certain products and industries,\nsuch as book s (Amazon) and travel (Booking.com). Then classified ads\n(Craigslist) and auction sites (eBay) decimated the newspaper industry,\nwhich has been further disrupted in recent years by Twitter, the Huffington\nPost, Vice and Medium. More recently, entire industries—music, for\nexample, thanks initially to Apple’s iTunes—have been disrupted.\nNow, in 2014, we are hard-pressed to identify any industry that hasn’t\nbeen fundamentally disrupted. And not just businesses, but jobs as well. As\nDavid Rose, a leading angel investor and founder of Gust, says, “Every\nsingle job function we can identify is being fundamentally transformed.”\nEven “old” industries such as construction are in the throes of disruption.\nMike Halsall, a construction company executive, told us that significant\ndisruptions to his industry include:\nIncreased collaboration (making an opaque industry more transparent\nand substantially more efficient)\nEver-more sophisticated design software and visualization\n3D printing\nHalsall estimates that the sum of these disruptions could reduce the\nnumber of people working in construction by more than 25 percent within ten\nyears. (The construction industry, by the way, represents a $4.7 trillion\nindustry annually.) In the corporate travel industry, Russ Howell, EVP ofGlobal Technology at BCD Travel, notes that 50 percent of the transactions\nat telephone-based call centers moved to the Internet in less than a decade.\nFurthermore, he expects 50 percent of those to move to mobile smartphones\nwithin three years.\nAs this new information-based paradigm causes the very metabolism of\nthe world to heat up, we’re increasingly feeling its macroeconomic impact.\nFor example, the cheapest 3D printers now cost only $100, which means that\nwithin five years or so most of us will be able to afford 3D printers to\nfabricate toys, cutlery, tools and fittings—essentially anything we’re able to\ndream up. The implications of this “printing revolution” are almost\nunfathomable.\nSo are the potential repercussions. Consider that, for all of its advances\nover the past few decades, China’s economy is still fundamentally based on\nthe manufacturing and assembly of cheap plastic parts. This means that within\na decade, the Chinese economy could be under serious threat from 3D\nprinting technology. And that’s just one industry. (Next, consider the ripple\neffect if an economically distressed China decides to call its overseas debt.)\nHistorically, disruptive breakthroughs always occur when disparate fields\ncross. Consider, for example, how combining water power with the textile\nloom helped launch the Industrial Revolution. Today, we are essentially\ncross-connecting all innovative new fields. And not just new fields: similar\ncollisions are also occurring in age-old disciplines as well, from art and\nbiology to chemistry and economics. It’s no wonder that Larry Keeley,\nfounder of Doblin Group, a noted innovation strategy consulting firm, says, “I\nhave never, in thirty-two years, seen anything like the pace of change we’re\nseeing today.”Even industries that were once thought impervious to technology are being\naffected via second-order impacts of information. For example, in January\n2013 Santiago Bilinkis, a renowned entrepreneur in Argentina, noticed that\nBuenos Aires car wash operators had seen their revenues drop 50 percent\nover the previous decade. Given Argentina’s growing middle class, a steady\nincrease in the sales of luxury cars and a popu lation that takes pride in\nshowcasing clean cars, the fall in revenue made no sense. Bilinkis spent\nthree months researching the situation, checking whether there were more car\nwashes on the market (there weren’t) or if new water conservation rules had\nbeen introduced (they hadn’t). After eliminating all the possibilities, he\nstumbled upon the answer: Thanks to increased computing power and data,\nweather forecasters had become 50 percent more accurate in their\npredictions during that period. When drivers know it’s going to rain, they\nskip the car wash, resulting in fewer visits. Thus have computational\nimprovements in weather forecasting delivered a body  blow to an industry as\nseemingly immune to technology advances as Buenos Aires car wash\noperators.\nTo fully comprehend the sheer acceleration we’re seeing, recall the $10\nbillion in investment that was lost on Iridium and other satellite efforts in the\n90s. Today, twenty years later, a new breed of satellite companies—Skybox,\nPlanet Labs, Nanosatisfi and Satellogic—are all launching nanosatellites\n(which are, essentially, the size of a shoebox). The cost per launch is about\n$100,000 per satellite—a fraction of the $1 billion Iridium incurred per\nlaunch for its constellation. More important, by launching a cluster of\nnanosatellites operating in a coordinated, meshed configuration, thecapability of these new satellites blows away what the previous generation\ncould do.\nFor example, Planet Labs already has thirty-one satellites in orbit and\nplans to launch another one hundred during 2014. Satellogic, operating out of\nArgentina, has already launched its first three satellites and will soon be able\nto provide real-time video anywhere on earth to a one-meter resolution.\nEmiliano Kargieman, the founder of Satellogic, estimates the total cost of\nlaunching his fleet will be less than $200 million. All-told, this new breed of\nsatellite companies is operating at one-ten-thousandth the cost and delivering\nabout 100x  better performance than twenty years ago—a  millionfold\nincrease. Now that’s an Iridium Moment.\nKey Takeaways\nThe experts in many fields will project linearly\nin times of exponential change.\nThe explosive transition from film to digital\nphotography is now occurring in several\naccelerating technologies.\nWe are information-enabling everything.\nAn information-enabled environment delivers\nfundamentally disruptive oppor tunities.\nEven traditional industries are ripe for\ndisruption.CHAPTER TWO\nA Tale of Two Companies\nIn one of the most iconic moments in modern business history, Steve Jobs\nrocked the world in January 2007  with his announcement of the Apple iPhone,\nwhich debuted six months later.\nLiterally everything in high tech changed that day—indeed, you might even\ncall it a Singularity—as all existing strategies in consumer electronics were\ninstantly rendered obsolete. At that moment, the entire future of the digital\nworld had to be reconsidered.\nTwo months later, Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia spent a staggering\n$8.1 billion to buy Navteq, a navigation and road-mapping company. Nokia\npursued Navteq because the latter dominated the in-road traffic sensor\nindustry. Nokia concluded that control of those sensors would enable it to\ndominate mapping and mobile and online local information—assets that\nwould act as a defensive barrier against the increasing market predations of\nGoogle and Apple.\nThe stratospheric price tag represented Navteq’s near-monopoly of the\nroad sensor industry. In Europe alone, Navteq’s sensors covered\napproximately a quarter-million miles in thirty-five major cities across\nthirteen countries. Nokia was convinced that global, Navteq-powered, real-\ntime traffic monitoring would enable it to both compete with Google’s\ngrowing presence in real-time data and fend off Apple’s revolutionary new\nproduct.",

        "name": "Chapter Two: A Tale of Two Companies",
        "contents": "That was the theory, at least. Unfortunately for Nokia, a small Israeli\ncompany called Waze was founded around the same time.\nInstead of making a massive capital investment in in-road sensor\nhardware, the founders of Waze chose instead to crowdsource location\ninformation by leveraging the GPS sensors on its users’ phones—the new\nworld of smartphones just announced at Apple by Steve Jobs—to capture\ntraffic information. Within two years, Waze was gathering traffic data from as\nmany sources as Navteq had road sensors, and within four years it had ten\ntimes as many sources. What’s more, the cost of adding each new source was\nessentially zero, not to mention that Waze’s users regularly upgraded their\nphones—and thus Waze’s information base. In contrast, the Navteq system\ncost a fortune to upgrade.\nNokia made a gigantic defensive bet in acquiring an asset in the hopes of\nmaking an end-run around the iPhone. It was the kind of move that is\ncelebrated in business—if it succeeds, that is. But because Nokia didn’t\nunderstand the larger, exponential implications of Leveraged Assets (see\nChapter Three), the effort failed spectacularly. By June 2012, Nokia’s market\nvaluation had tumbled from $140 billion to $8.2 billion—pretty much what it\nspent to acquire Navteq. Not only had the world’s largest mobile phone\ncompany lost its lead but because it had also lost the capital needed to claw\nits way back, it also likely lost its role as a leading industry player forever.\nIn June 2013 Google acquired Waze for $1.1 billion. At that time, the\ncompany had no infrastructure, no hardware and no more than one hundred\nemployees. What it did have, however, was fifty million users. More\nprecisely, Waze had fifty million “human traffic sensors,” double those of just\na year before. That number has probably doubled again since then, to one\nhundred million location sensors globally.\nNokia followed the old linear rules and bought physical infrastructure\n(remember Iridium?), hoping it would prove to be a competitive barrier. Itwas, of course, but only for in-road sensor users, not against information-\nenabled mobile phone application designers. In contrast, Waze leapfrogged\nthe world of physical sensors simply by piggybacking on its users’\nsmartphones.\nIn a real-time epilogue to the Nokia/Navteq story, as we write this,\nMicrosoft has acquired Nokia’s cell phone device business and patent\nportfolio for $7.2 billion, or about $1 billion less than Nokia paid for Navteq.\nJust as Nokia has fallen far from its early lead in the cell phone industry,\nMicrosoft has struggled to gain share for its Windows Phone software.\nMicrosoft’s stated rationale for the Nokia deal is to accelerate its share\nand profits in phones; to create a first-rate Microsoft phone experience for\nusers; to prevent Google and Apple from foreclosing app innovation,\nintegration, distribution and economics; and to avail itself of an outsized\nfinancial oppor tunity fueled by growth in the smartphone industry. Time will\ntell how this scenario plays out, and whether Nokia’s acquisition is a case of\nlinear, exponential or just an intellectual property land grab.\nThe story of Waze versus Navteq is important, and relevant to this book , not\njust because of who won and who lost, but also because of the fundamental\ndifference in the two companies’ approaches to ownership. Nokia spent\nenormous resources to purchase and own billions of dollars in physical\nassets, while Waze simply accessed information already available on user-\nowned technology.\nThe former is a classic example of linear thinking, the latter of exponential\nthinking. While Nokia’s linear strategy was dependent on the speed of\nphysical installation, Waze benefited from the exponentially faster speed at\nwhich information can be accessed and shared.From time immemorial, human beings have worked to own “stuff” and then\ntrade access to it. This behavior started in tribes, was adopted by clans, and\nthen later spread to nations, empires, and most recently, global markets,\nmaking possible ever-larger human institutions. Value has always been\ngenerated by owning more land, more equipment, more machinery, more\npeople. Ownership was the perfect strategy for managing scarce resources\nand ensuring a relatively predictable, stable environment.\nThe more you had—that is, the more value you “owned”—the wealthier\nand more powerful you were. To manage that asset, of course, you needed\npeople. Lots of them. If a plot of land was twice as big, you needed twice as\nmany people to farm or protect it. Luckily, our span of control didn’t reach\nvery far across the landscape, so this was a perfectly workable arrangement.\nOnce we reached a critical mass of people needed to manage or protect\nour owned assets, we created hierarchies—in every tribe or village, there\nwas an implicit or explicit hierarchical order to the power structure. The\nbigger the tribe, the bigger the hierarchy. Then, beginning in the Middle Ages\nbut fully taking hold with the Industrial Revolution and rise of the modern\ncorporation, that local, hierarchical thinking was mapped onto companies and\ninto governmental structures, a design that with only limited modification has\nheld ever since.\nToday, we still manage and measure ourselves on this linear scale. That\nis: x amount of work takes y amount of resources, 2x needs 2y, and so on of\never-greater arithmetic magnitude.\nAutomation, mass production, robotics and even virtualization with\ncomputers altered the slope of this line, but it still remained linear. If one\nconcrete mixer truck replaces one hundred laborers hand-mixing concrete,\ntwo trucks replace two hundred laborers. Similarly, much of society is also\nmeasured on this basis: the number of doctors per 100,000 patients, class sizeper teacher, GDP and energy per capita. Labor is paid hourly, as are legal\nfees, and housing is priced by the square foot.\nIn business, the way we build most products and services continues to\nmirror this linear, incremental, sequential thinking. Thus, the classic way to\nbuild a product, be it a giant airliner or a thumbnail-sized microprocessor, is\nthrough a template stage-gate process called New Product Development, or\nNPD, which includes the following steps:\n1. Idea generation\n2. Idea screening\n3. Concept development and testing\n4. Business analysis\n5. Beta and market testing\n6. Technical implementation\n7. Commercialization\n8. New product pricing\nSo codified is this process into the DNA of modern business there is even\na designated industry association for it, called the Product Development and\nManagement Association (PDMA).\nYou might think that while this old-fashioned linear approach is still\nwidespread among mature industries, it has long been abandoned in the world\nof hot new technologies. You would be wrong. The linear process remains\npervasive across the world economy, taking on different names in its different\niterations. In software, for example, it’s been called the waterfall approach.\nAnd while new development methods, like Agile, have croppe d up to short-\ncircuit this approach and parallelize some of the steps, the basic paradigm is\nstill linear and incremental. Whether you are making locomotives or iPhone\napps, linear product development remains the predominant name of the game.See the diagram below, noting that this works when both problem and desired\nsolution are precisely known.\nWhen you think linearly, when your operations are linear, and when your\nmeasures of performance and success are linear, you cannot help but end up\nwith a linear organization, one that sees the world through a linear lens—as\ndid even multi-billion dollar, technologically cutting-edge Nokia. Such an\norganization cannot help but have many of the following characteristics:\nTop-down and hierarchical in its organization\nDriven by financial outcomes\nLinear, sequential thinkingInnovation primarily from within\nStrategic planning largely an extrapolation from the past\nRisk intolerance\nProcess inflexibility\nLarge number of employees\nControls own assets\nStrongly invested in status quo\nAs noted business author John Hagel said: “Our organizations are set up\nto withstand change from the outside,” rather than to embrace those changes\neven when they are useful. Aerospace engineer Burt Rutan’s corollary to this\nis, “Defend and don ’t question.”\nNot surprisingly, given all of these characteristics, linear organizations\nwill rarely disrupt their own products or services. They haven’t the tools, the\nattitude or the perspective to do so. What they will do, and what they are built\nto do, is to keep getting bigger in order to take advantage of economies of\nscale. Scale—bu t linear scale—is the raison d’être of the linear organization.\nJohn Seely Brown calls this “scalable efficiency” and maintains that it is the\nparadigm that drives most corporate strategy and corporate architectures.\nClayton Christensen immortalized this type of thinking in his business classic,\nThe Innov ator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to\nFall.\nMost large organizations use what is called a matrix structure. Product\nmanagement, marketing and sales are often aligned vertically, and support\nfunctions such as legal, HR, finance and IT are usually horizontal. So the\nperson handling legal for a product has two reporting lines, one to the head of\nproduct, who has revenue accountability, and the other to the head of legal,\nwhose job it is to ensure consistency across numerous products. This is great\nfor command and control, but it’s terrible for accountability, speed and risk\ntolerance. Every time you try to do something, you have to get authorizationfrom all the muckety-mucks in HR, legal, accounting and so on, which takes\ntime.\nAnother major issue Salim has observed with matrix structures is that,\nover time, power accrues to the horizontals. Often, HR or legal have no\nincentive to say yes, so their default answer becomes no (which is why HR is\noften referred to as “inhuman resources”). It’s not that HR people are bad\npeople. But, over time, their incentives end up at cross-purposes with those of\nproduct managers.\nOver the last few decades, the race to capture economies of scale has\nresulted in an explosion of large globalized corporations. At the same time,\nthe pressure for higher and higher margins has led to offshoring, international\nexpansion and mega-mergers in the name of cutting costs, increasing revenues\nand improving the bottom line.\nBut each of these changes comes at great cost, because the flip side of size\nis flexibility. However hard they try, large companies with extensive facilities\nfilled with tens of thousands of employees scattered around the world are\nchallenged to operate nimbly in a fast-moving world. In his analysis of\nexponential disruption, Hagel also notes: “One of the key issues in an\nexponential world…is that whatever understanding you have today is going to\nrapidly become obsolete, and so you have to continue to refresh your\neducation about the technologies and about the organizational capabilities.\nThat’s going to be very challenging.” Rapid or disruptive change is something\nthat large, matrixed organizations find extremely difficult. Indeed, those who\nhave attempted it have found that the organization’s “immune system” is liable\nto respond to the perceived threat with an attack. Gabriel Baldinucci, Chief\nStrategy Officer at Singularity University and a former principal at Virgin\nGroup’s U.S. venture arm, has observed that there are two levels of immune\nresponses. The first is to defend the core business because it’s the status quo;the second is to defend yourself as an individual because there’s more ROI for\nyou than for the organization.\nWhat makes traditional companies highly efficient at expansion and\ngrowth as long as market conditions remain unchanged is also what makes\nthem extremely vulnerable to disruption. As Peter Thiel said, “Globalization\nis moving from one to N copying existing products. That was the 20 century.\nNow in the 21 century we move into a world where zero to one and creating\nnew products will increasingly be a priority for companies due to the rise of\ndifferent exponential technologies.”\nWhatever else they may be, big companies aren’t stupid. They know about\nthis structural weakness and many are striving to fix it. For example, one of\nLarry Page’s first steps upon becoming CEO of Google in April 2011 was to\nstrip management layers and flatten the organization. Similar programs have\nbeen implemented at Haier, in China, and other large organizations. While\nsome of these fixes have proven successful, in the longer term, such flattening\nis merely a stopgap, because the total number of employees—the financial\nweight and resistance to change—rarely diminishes.\nOf course, not all industries are “going lean.” One industry headed in the\noppos ite direction is pharmaceuticals—to what we believe will be the\nindustry’s regret. Once the low-hanging fruit of blockbuster drugs began\nwinding down around 2012 , instead of breaking into smaller, more flexible\nunits, Big Pharma chose to pursue the consolidations and mergers that seemed\nto make Wall Street happy. We believe that increased size will reduce the\nflexibility of pharmaceutical companies even further, thus increasing their\nexposure to disruption.\nOne exemplar of that pending disruption is teenager Jack Andraka, who at\nthe age of fourteen single-handedly developed an early-stage detection test for\npancreatic cancer that costs just three cents. His approach (awaiting peer\nreview) is 26,000 times cheaper, 400 times more sensitive, and 126 timesth\nstfaster than today’s diagnostics. Big Pharma has no idea how to deal with Jack,\nwho is one of many wunderkinds emerging globally, all of them with the\npotential to disrupt great companies and long-established industries. The\nJacks of the world bring exponential thinking to our linear world—a nd\nnothing is going to stop them.\nGetting back to the Navteq versus Waze story, one thing we hope to make\nclear is that traditional linear thinking doesn’t work in an exponential world.\nSimply put, it cannot compete. Salim saw this firsthand at Yahoo in 2007,\nwhich despite its web bona fides, operated within a classic linear matrix\norganizational structure. Every time a new product was launched or an old\none modified, the team behind it had to jump through several clearance hoops\n—branding, legal, privacy and PR, etc.—each step taking days or weeks,\nwhich meant that by the time anything finally landed in the consumer Internet\nspace, it was usually too late; some startup or another had already gotten\ntraction. Salim’s conclusion about one root cause of Yahoo’s troubles is that\nits organizational structure is antithetical to the industry.\nYahoo is hardly alone. Even the mighty Google struggles with this. It took\ntwo years and enormous effort to get Google+ out the door. Even though the\nproduct is brilliantly crafted, by the time of its launch in the summer of 2011,\nFacebook  had an almost insurmountable lead.\nAs we saw in Chapter One, this pace of change isn’t going to slow down\nanytime soon. In fact, Moore’s Law all but guarantees that it will continue to\nspeed up—a nd speed up exponentially—for at least several decades. And\ngiven the cross impact into other technologies, if the last fifteen years has seen\nenormous disruption in the business world, the next fifteen will make that\ndisruption seem tame by comparison.\nInternet companies have changed the way we advertise and market. They\nhave transformed the world of newspapers and publishing. And they have\nprofoundly changed the way we communicate and interact with one another.One reason for that change is that the cost of distributing a product or service,\nparticularly if can be converted almost entirely to information, has droppe d\nalmost to zero. It used to require millions of dollars in servers and software to\nlaunch a software company. Thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), it now\ncosts just a tiny fraction of that amount. Similar stories can be found in every\ndepartment in every industry of the modern economy.\nHistory and common sense make clear that you cannot radically transform\nevery part of an organization—and accelerate the underlying clock of that\nenterprise to hyper-speed—w ithout fundamentally changing the nature of that\norganization. Which is why, over the last few years, a new organizational\nscheme congruent with these changes has begun to emerge. We call it the\nExponential Organization precisely because it represents the structure best\nsuited to address the accelerated, non-linear, web-driven pace of modern life.\nAnd while even cutting-edge traditional companies can only achieve\narithmetic outputs per input, an ExO achieves geometric outputs per input by\nriding the doubling-exponential pattern of information-based technologies.\nTo achieve this scalability, new ExO organizations such as Waze are\nturning the traditional organization inside out. Rather than owning assets or\nworkforces and incrementally seeing a return on those assets, ExOs leverage\nexternal resources to achieve their objectives. For example, they maintain a\nvery small core of employees and facilities, allowing enormous flexibility as\nmargins soar. They enlist their customers and leverage offline and online\ncommunities in everything from product design to application development.\nThey float atop the existing and emerging infrastructure rather than trying to\nown it. And they grow at incredible rates precisely because they aren’t\ndedicated to ow ning their market, but rather to enlisting it to their purposes. A\ngreat example is Medium, which is disrupting the magazine business by\nrelying on its users to provide long-form articles.It is our belief that ExOs will overwhelm traditional linear organizations\nin most industries because they take better advantage of the information-based\nexternalities inaccessible to older structures, a feat that will empower them to\ngrow faster—shockingly faster—than their linear counterparts, and then\naccelerate from there.\nIt’s hard to pin down exactly when this new organizational form emerged.\nVarious aspects of ExOs have been around for decades, but it is only over the\nlast few years that they have really started to matter. If we had to pick an\nofficial ExO origin date, it would be March 2006, when Amazon launched\nAmazon Web Services and created the low-cost “Cloud” for medium and\nsmall businesses. From that date on, the cost of running a data center moved\nfrom a fixed CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) cost to a variable cost. Today, it\nis almost impossible to find a single startup that doesn’t use AWS.\nWe have even found a simple metric that helps to identify and distinguish\nemerging Exponential Organizations: a minimum 10x improvement in output\nover four to five years.\nThe following shows some ExOs and their minimum 10x performance\ninprovement over their peers:\nAirbnb\nHotels90x more listings per employee\nGitHub\nSoftware109x  more repositories per employee\nLocal Motors\nAutomotive1000x  cheaper to produce new car\nmodel, 5-22x faster process for a car to\nproduce (depending on vehicle)\nQuirky\nConsumer Goods10x faster product development (29 da ys\nvs 300 da ys)\nGoogle Ventures\nInvestments2.5x more investments in early stage\nstartups, 10x  faster through designprocess\nValve\nGaming30x more market cap per employee\nTesla\nAutomotive30x more market cap per employee\nTangerine (formerly\nING Direct\nCanada)\nBanking7x more customers per employee, 4x\nmore deposits per customer\nLook again at Waze. By harnessing information on its users’ phones, Waze\ncurrently has one hundred times the traffic movement signals that\nNavteq/Nokia acquired by buying the physical sensors buried in roads. Even\nthough Waze was just a tiny startup company with just a few dozen employees,\nit quickly ran down and overtook the linear Nokia, despite its thousands of\nemployees. Nokia thought it dominated the mobile phone world—a nd while it\nonce had, within the new paradigm it didn’t stand a chance.\nTwo key factors enabled Waze to succeed, and those two factors hold true\nfor all next-generation ExO companies:\nAccess resources you don’t own. In Waze’s case, the company made use\nof the GPS readings already on its users’ smartphones.\nInformation is your greatest asset. More reliably than any other asset,\ninformation has the potential to double regularly. Rather than simply\nassembling assets, the key to success is accessing valuable caches of\nexisting information. Andrew Rasiej, chairman of the New York Tech\nMeetup, said it best: “I think of Waze as a civics app. It’s collecting\ninformation about the movement of cars and people in public places.\nWhat else could you do w ith that data?”Taking Rasiej’s observation a step further, the real, fundamental question\nof our exponential age is: What else can be  information-enabled?\nThe key outcome when you access resources and information-enable them\nis that your marginal costs drop to zero. Quite possibly the granddaddy of\ninformation-based ExOs is Google, which doesn’t own the web pages it\nscans. Its revenue model, the butt of many jokes ten years ago, has enabled\nGoogle to become a $400 billion company, a milestone it reached by\nessentially manipulating textual (and now video) information. LinkedIn and\nFacebook  together are worth over $200 billion, and that’s just as a result of\ndigitizing our relationships—that is, turning them into information. It is our\nbelief that most great new enterprises in the years to come will either build\ntheir businesses off new sources of information or by converting previously\nanalog environments into information. And that environment increasingly\nincludes hardware (sensors, 3D printers/scanners, biotech, etc.): As noted\nearlier, the Tesla S, which has just seventeen different moving parts in its\ndrivetrain, can be thought of as computer masquerading as a supremely\ncapable luxury car, one that it updates itself every week via a software\ndownload.\nThis search for new sources of information that can underpin new\ncompanies and businesses is at the heart of the revolution often labeled Big\nData. By combining vast stores of data with powerful new analytical tools,\nthere is an oppor tunity to see the world in a new way—and to turn the\nresulting information into new business oppor tunities.\nSources of this Big Data are emerging everywhere. For example, we\nmentioned the three separate initiatives for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nsystems that within a few years will deliver real-time video and images\nanywhere on the planet. Despite the inevitable privacy and security concerns\nbound to arise with the launch of LEO satellite systems, there is no doubt thatscores, even hundreds, of new businesses will emerge from access to this\nmassive new information source.\nFor instance, what if you could count the number of cars in any or all\nSears or Walmart parking lots throughout the country? Or predict natural\ncalamities like tsunamis and typhoons, as well as their impact? Or measure\nthe increasing wattage along the Amazon River at night? Or track every\ncontainer ship, in real time, around the world? Soon you can—either via\nnanosatellites or global Internet access initiatives such a Google’s Project\nLoon and Facebook ’s drones strategies.\nEven closer down this road is the Google autonomous automobile. The\nkey navigational technology it uses is light radar, also known as lidar. Each\ncar has a spinning lidar unit on its roof that creates a live 3D map of its\nsurroundings to a range of about one hundred meters. As it moves, a Google\ncar collects almost a gigabyte of data per second and creates a 3D image of\nits surroundings to within a one-centimeter resolution. It can even compare\ntwo images to get a perfect before-and-after analysis. If you move a plant off\nyour front porch, if you leave a window open or if your teenager sneaks out of\nhis or her bedroom at night, Google will know.\nThis is not just static information. It is also dynamic information—da ta\nthat registers the natural world not simply as it is, but as it changes. Mountains\n(petabytes) of data can be analytically sliced and diced to discover\npreviously unknown truths about the world around us—truths that will result\nin oppor tunities currently unimaginable.\nAs outlined earlier, traditional organizational structures, designed ove r the\nlast few hundred years to hierarchically manage physical assets or people, are\nrapidly becoming obsolete. To compete in our rapidly changing world, we\nneed a new kind of organization, one that is not only able manage this change,\nbut also thrives on it.We opened Chapter One with a discussion of what we refer to as the\nIridium Moment. By ironic coincidence, the extinction of the dinosaurs was\nrevealed by an iridium layer in rock formations; this time around, the\ndestructive agent is an Information Comet. What if we are having another,\ncollective Iridium Moment? One that doesn’t just involve a single giant\ncorporation that has failed to recognize the revolutionary nature of the\ntechnological change taking place around it, but a whole species—indeed the\ndominant species—of large corporations in the modern economy. What if they\nare all facing the same fate as Iridium?\nThat question, and the quest for a strategy that both established and new\ncompanies can use to survive and thrive in this new world will be the subject\nof the rest of this book . Exponential Organizations have the capability to adapt\nto this new world of deep and ubiquitous information and convert it to\ncompetitive advantage. The ExO, in fact, is the appropriate commercial\nresponse to our new exponential world.\nWe’ll next take a closer look at this remarkable new organizational form:\nhow it works, how it is organized, how it scales its operations and why it will\nsucceed in a transformed marketplace when other, established organizational\nschemes won’t. Most of all, we will explore why, if we are to succeed in\nbusiness, the Exponential Organization is our destiny.\nKey Takeaways\nOur organizational structures have evolved to\nmanage scarcity. The concept of ownership\nworks well for scarcity, but accessing or sharing\nworks better in an abundant, information-based\nworld.While the information-based world is now\nmoving exponentially, our organizational\nstructures are still very linear (especially large\nones).\nWe’ve learned how to scale technology; now it’s\ntime to scale the organization.\nMatrix structures don’t work in an exponential,\ninformation-based world.\nExOs have learned how to organize around an\ninformation-based world.\nDavid S. Rose, author of the bestselling book  Angel Investing: The Gust\nGuide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups, sums it up\nmore dramatically:\n“Any company designed for success in the 20  century is\ndoomed to failure in the 21.”th\nstCHAPTER THREE\nThe Exponential Organization\nThe modern corporation takes great pride in how fast it can bring products\nand services to market compared to companies in the past. Annual reports,\nadvertisements and speeches trumpet how companies have virtualized,\naccelerated supply chains, shortened approval cycles and improved\ndistribution channels.\nThe result is that it now takes an average of between two hundred fifty and\nthree hundred days for a typical Consumer Packaged Goods  (CPG) company\nto move a new product from invention to retail stores’ shelves—and that,\nbelieve it or not, is considered a blistering pace.\nConsider Quirky, a pioneering Exponential Organization in the same CPG\nindustry. It accomplishes this same cycle in just twenty-nine days. That’s\ntwenty-nine days from idea generation to seeing the product on sale at your\nlocal Walmart.\nA traditional car company spends about $3 billion to bring a new car\nmodel to market. Local Motors, an ExO, accomplishes the same thing for just\n$3 m illion—a 1,000x  improvement, albeit not to the same production scale.\nNext, consider Airbnb, a company that leverages users’ extra bedrooms.\nFounded in 2008, Airbnb currently has 1,324 employees and operates\n500,000 listings in 33,000 cities. However, Airbnb owns no physical assets\nand is worth almost $10 billion. That’s more than the value of Hyatt Hotels,\nwhich has 45,000 e mployees spread across 549 pr operties. And while Hyatt’s",

        "contents": "business is comparatively flat, Airbnb’s number of room-nights delivered is\ngrowing exponentially. At its current pace, Airbnb will be the biggest hotelier\nin the world by late 2015.\nSimilarly, Uber, the Airbnb of cars—Uber converts private automobiles\ninto taxis—has been valued at $17 billion. Like Airbnb, Uber has no assets,\nno workforce (to speak of) and is also growing exponentially.If you don’t find these valuations sufficiently eye-opening, go back and\nread them again—this time reminding yourself that each of these Exponential\nOrganizations is fewer than s ix years old.\nAs we saw with Waze in Chapter Two, there are two fundamental drivers\nthat enable ExOs to achieve this level of scalability. The first is that some\naspect of the company’s product has been information-enabled and thus,\nfollowing Moore’s Law, can take on the doubling characteristics of\ninformation growth.\nThe second is that, thanks to the fact that information is essentially liquid,\nmajor business functions can be transferred outside of the organization—to\nusers, fans, partners or the general public. (We’ll revisit this concept later.)\nLet’s now examine the major characteristics of Exponential Organizations.\nBased on our research—which includes the top one hundred fastest growing\nstartups worldwide over the last six years—we have identified common traits\nacross all ExOs. They include a Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP), as\nwell as ten other attributes that reflect the internal mechanisms and\nexternalities they’re leveraging to achieve exponential growth. We use the\nacronym SCALE to reflect the five external attributes, and the acronym IDEAS\nfor the five internal attributes. Not every ExO has all ten attributes but the\nmore it has, the more scalable it tends to be. Our research indicates that a\nminimum of four implemented attributes will achieve the ExO label and have\nyou accelerate away from your competition.\nIn this chapter we will look at the Massive Transformative Purpose and\nthe five external attributes that comprise SCALE. In the next chapter we will\ninvestigate the five internal attributes that make up IDEAS. A good metaphor\nwe will use to frame ExO attributes is the two hemispheres of the brain. The\nright brain manages growth, creativity and uncertainty, while the left brain\nfocuses on order, control and stability.",

        "contents": "Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)\nExponential Organizations, almost by definition, think BIG. There’s a\ngood reason for that: if a company thinks small, it is unlikely to pursue a\nbusiness strategy that will achieve rapid growth. Even if the company\nsomehow manages to achieve an impressive level of growth, the scale of its\nbusiness will quickly outpace its business model and leave the company lost\nand directionless. Thus, ExOs must aim high.\nThat’s why, when we look at the position statements of existing\nExponential Organizations, we encounter statements of purpose that might\nhave seemed outrageous in years past:\nTED: “Ideas worth spreading.”\nGoogle: “Organize the world’s information.”X Prize Foundation: “Bring about radical breakthroughs for the benefit\nof humanity.”\nQuirky: “Make invention accessible.”\nSingularity University: “Positively impact one billion people.”\nAt first glance, these statements may seem to align with the trend in recent\nyears to rewrite corporate statements to be shorter, simpler and more\ngeneralized. But on closer inspection, you’ll note that each of the statements is\nalso very aspirational. None states what the organization does, but rather\nwhat it aspires to accomplish. The aspirations are neither narrow nor even\ntechnology-specific. Rather, they aim to capture the hearts and minds—and\nimaginations and ambitions—of those both inside and (especially) outside the\norganization.\nThis, then, is the Massive Transformative Purpose, or MTP—the higher,\naspirational purpose of the organization. Every ExO we know has one. Some\naim to transform the planet, others just an industry. But radical transformation\nis the name of the game. And while companies of the past might have felt\nembarrassed to make such claims, today’s ExO declares with sincerity and\nconfidence that it intends to accomplish near-miracles. Even a company in a\ncomparatively small market can “think MTP”: Dollar Shave Club, for\nexample, is transforming the shaving industry with the mantra “A dollar a\nmonth.”\nIt’s important to note that an MTP is not a mission statement. Consider\nCisco’s mission statement, which is neither inspirational nor aspirational:\n“Shape the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and\noppor tunity for our customers, employees, investors, and ecosystem partners.”\nWhile there’s some Purpose there, and it’s somewhat Massive, it’s certainly\nnot Transformative. Furthermore, it is a statement that could be used by at\nleast a dozen Internet companies. If we were to write Cisco’s MTP, it wouldlikely be something along the lines of, “Connecting everyone, everything,\neverywhere—all the time.” Now that would be exciting.\nThe most important outcome of a proper MTP is that it generates a cultural\nmovement—what John Hagel and John Seely Brown call the “Power of Pull.”\nThat is, the MTP is so inspirational that a community forms around the ExO\nand spontaneously begins operating on its own, ultimately creating its own\ncommunity, tribe and culture. Think of those lines outside the Apple Store or\nthe waiting lists for TED’s annual conference. Each has an emergent\necosystem so excited about that product or service that it literally pulls the\nproducts and services out from the core organization and assumes its own\nownership, complete with marketing, support services, and even design and\nmanufacturing. Consider the Apple iPhone: with a universe of supporting\nproducts and a million user-generated applications, who really owns it?\nThis cultural shift inspired by the MTP has its own secondary effects. For\none thing, it moves the focal point of a team from internal politics to external\nimpact. Most contemporary large companies are internally focused and often\nhave lost touch—except through rigid and formalized marketing surveys and\nfocus groups—with their market and customers.\nIn our increasingly volatile world, this perspective can be fatal. It is\ncritical for a modern enterprise to constantly look outward—n ot least to spot\na rapidly approaching technological or competitive threat. If you’re at\nGoogle, you are constantly asking yourself (as per the company’s statement):\n“How can I better organize the world’s information?” At Singularity\nUniversity the question we ask ourselves at every turning point is: “Will this\npositively impact a billion people?”\nThe biggest imperative of a worthy MTP is its Purpose. Building on the\nseminal work by Simon Sinek, the Purpose must answer two critical “why”\nquestions:Why do this work?\nWhy does the organization exist?\nAn MTP as a Competitive Edge\nA strong MTP is especially advantageous to “first movers.” If the MTP is\nsufficiently sweeping, there’s no place for competitors to go but beneath it.\nAfter all, it would be very hard for another organization to pop up and\nannounce, “We’re also going to organize the world’s information, but better.”\nOnce companies realize this singular advantage we can expect a land grab of\ngenuine MTPs in the near future.\nA strong MTP also serves as an excellent recruiter for new talent, as well\nas a magnet for retaining top talent—bot h increasingly difficult propos itions\nin today’s hypercompetitive talent marketplace. In addition, an MTP serves as\na stabilizing force during periods of random growth and enables organizations\nto scale with less turbulence.\nThe MTP is not only an effective attractor and retainer for customers and\nemployees but also for the company ecosystem at large (developers, startups,\nhackers, NGOs, governments, suppliers, partners, etc.). As a result, it lowers\nthe acquisition, transaction and retention costs of these stakeholders.\nMTPs don’t operate in isolation. Rather, they create a penumbra around\nthem that influences every part of the organization. A prime early indicator is\nRed Bull, whose MTP is “Giving You Wings.”\nThat’s why, over time, we can expect brands to blend into MTPs, along\nthe way becoming increasingly aspirational. Why? Because aspirational\nbrands create positive feedback loops  in the ExO’s community: customers feel\ngood about the products and are increasingly proud to be part of a larger,\nvirtuous movement. Aspirational branding helps lower costs, improveseffectiveness and speeds learning by leveraging intrinsic, rather than external,\nmotivation.\nThere is also an economic advantage in embracing an MTP. The world is\nfacing many grand challenges, and as Peter Diamandis says, “the world’s\nbiggest problems are the world’s biggest markets.” As a result, over the next\ndecade we expect even shareholders to incorporate MTPs into their stock\nportfolio strategies.\nAs an analog to MTPs, we also see a worldwide increase in social\nenterprises. A study by the G8 in 2013 estimates there are 688,000 social\nenterprises, generating $270 billion annually. These organizations come in\nmany forms (Benefit or B Corporations, Triple Bottom Line, L3Cs, the\nConscious Capital movement, the Slow Money movement) and leverage their\nMTPs to integrate social and environmental issues—as well as profits—into\ntheir business processes. This trend started with the rise of corporate social\nresponsibility (CSR) programs in organizations. In 2012, 57 percent of the\nFortune 500 published a CSR report—double the number from the previous\nyear. The difference is that CSR initiatives are add-ons to most companies’\ncore business; for social enterprises, CSR initiatives are the core business.\nMartin Seligman, a leading expert on positive psychology, differentiates\nbetween three states of happiness: the pleasurable life (hedonistic,\nsuperficial), the good life (family and friends) and the meaningful life (finding\npurpose, transcending ego, working toward a higher good). Research shows\nthat Millennials—those born between 1984 and 2002—a re showing an\norientation towards seeking meaning and purpose in their lives. Worldwide,\nthey are becoming increasingly aspirational and, as such, will be drawn as\ncustomers, employees and investors to equally aspirational organizations—\nthat is, to companies that have MTPs and live up to their tenets. In fact, we\nexpect to see individuals coming up with their own MTPs, which will\njuxtapose, ove rlap and symbiotically exist with the organization’s MTP.According to the United Nations, extreme pove rty has decreased 80\npercent over the last thirty years, including among a majority of the five\nbillion people who will be online by 2020. We predict they’ll all be climbing\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in search of Self-Actualization.

        "name": "Staff on Demand",
        "contents": "Staff on Demand\nIn a 2012 white paper for the Aspen Institute, Michael Chui, a partner at\nthe McKinsey Global Institute, described employment theory in the 20\ncentury as follows:\nThe best way to harness human talent is through full-time,\nexclusive employment relationships where people are paid for\nthe amount of time they spend at a common location. They should\nbe organized in stable hierarchies where they are evaluated\nprimarily through the judgment of their superiors, and what and\nhow they do their jobs is prescribed.\nChui then proceeds to dismantle every phrase in that paragraph to show\nhow fundamentally out of date that theory has become in little more than athdecade. Literally none  of it applies today.\nFor any ExO, having Staff on Demand is a necessary characteristic for\nspeed, functionality and flexibility in a fast-changing world. Leveraging\npersonnel outside the base organization is key to creating and running a\nsuccessful ExO. The fact is, no matter how talented your employees, chances\nare that most of them are becoming obsolete and uncompetitive right before\nyour eyes.\nAs John Seely Brown has noted, the half-life of a learned skill used to be\nabout thirty years. Today it’s down to about five years. In his recent book , The\nStartup of You, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman notes that individuals will\nincreasingly learn to manage themselves as companies, with brand\nmanagement (MTP!), and marketing and sales functions all brought down to\nthe individual. Similarly, Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in\nEconomics in 1991, noted that enterprises are more like families than\nindustries, and that corporations are more of a sociological construct than an\neconomic one.\nFor any company today, having a permanent, full-time workforce is fraught\nwith growing peril as employees fail to keep their skills up to date, resulting\nin personnel in need of greater management. In our fast-changing global and\nInternet-driven marketplace, increasingly desperate organizations are turning\nto external and temporary workforces to fill their expertise gaps. For\nexample, in an effort to keep the overall skills of the organization fresh, AMP,\nAustralia’s largest insurance company, requires that half its 2,600- strong IT\ndepartment be made up of contractors. According to Annalie Killian, a global\nexecutive at AMP, such a requirement is not just helpful; in this day and age,\nit’s mandatory.While maintaining permanent staff is likely to remain more important in\ncertain equipment- and capital-intensive industries such as shipping, mining\nor construction, in any information-enabled business a large internal staff\nseems increasingly unnecessary, counterproductive and expensive. And the\nold argument that freelancers and contractors only increase the bureaucracy\nneeded to manage them quickly falls away too: thanks to the Internet, the cost\nof finding and tracking outside staff drops almost to zero. In addition, due to\nthe rapid rise in the number of Internet users, the volume and quality of\nfreelancers has gone up dramatically in the last ten years.\nGigwalk, which relies on half a million smart-phone-enabled workers,\noffers an example of how this new world of employment works. When\nProctor and Gamble needs to know how and where its merchandise is being\nplaced on Walmart shelves around the world, it can use Gigwalk’s platform to\ninstantly deploy thousands of people who are paid a few dollars to walk into\nWalmart and check the shelves. Results come in within an hour.\nStaff-on-demand initiatives similar to Gigwalk are springing up\neverywhere: oDesk, Roamler, Elance, TaskRabbit and Amazon’s venerable\nMechanical Turk are platforms where all levels of work, including highly\nskilled labor, can be outsourced. These companies, which represent just the\nfirst wave of this new business model, optimize the concept of paying for\nperformance to lower customer risk.\nFor talented workers, working on and getting paid for multiple projects is a\nparticularly welcome oppor tunity. But there’s another angle as well: an\nincrease in the diversity of ideas. The data science company Kaggle, for\nexample, offers a platform that hosts private and public algorithm contests in\nwhich more than 185,000 data scientists around the world vie for prizes and\nrecognition. In 2011, Insurance giant Allstate, with forty of the best actuariesand data scientists money could buy, wanted to see if its claims algorithm\ncould be improved upon, so it ran a contest on Kaggle.\nIt turned out that the Allstate algorithm, which has been carefully\noptimized for over six decades, was bested within three days by 107\ncompeting teams. Three months later, when the contest ended, Allstate’s\noriginal algorithm had been improved 271 pe rcent. And while the prize set the\ncompany back $10,000, t he resulting cost savings due to better algorithms was\nestimated to be in the tens of millions annually. Quite an interesting ROI.\nIn fact, in every one of Kaggle’s 150 contests to date, external data\nscientists have beaten the internal algorithms, often by a wide margin. And in\nmost cases outsiders (non-experts) have beaten the experts in a particular\ndomain, which shows the pow er of fresh thinking and diverse perspectives.\nIn years past, having a large workforce differentiated your enterprise and\nallowed it to accomplish more. Today, that same large workforce can become\nan anchor that reduces maneuverability and slows you down. Moreover,\ntraditional industries have great difficulty attracting on-demand high-skill\nworkers such as data scientists because the available positions are perceived\nas being low in terms of oppor tunity and high in terms of bureaucratic\nobstacles. A study commissioned by Deloitte found that 98 percent of recent\ndata science graduates went to work for Google, Facebook , LinkedIn or\nvarious startups. That doesn’t leave much talent left over for everybody  else.\nThat said, even Google’s workforce of 50,000 very smart employees\npales in comparison to the collective intelligence of the 2.4 billion people\nonline today. We have no doubt that the extraordinary capabilities of this\nmassive collection of intellectual capital will eventually emerge. In the words\nof Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired magazine:\nThe reality is that most of the world’s smartest people don’t have\nthe right credentials. They don’t speak the right language. Theydidn’t grow up in the right country. They didn’t go to the right\nuniversity. They don’t know about you and you don’t know about\nthem. They’re not available, and they already have a job.\nAs we conducted research for this book , it quickly became apparent how\neasy it is to outsource anything and everything. In fact, Timothy Ferris, author\nof the bestselling 4-Hour Workweek, has pioneered many new ideas around\nthis topic.\nA firm called Advisory Board Architects (ABA) presents a fascinating\nexample of how to take the Staff-on-Demand concept to a whole new level.\nABA noticed two issues with company boards: First, as Jaime Grego-Mayer,\na partner at ABA, notes, “95 percent of all boards are simply not managed,”\nsince most of a CEO’s attention goes to managing the company. Second,\nremoving a non-performing board member can be a delicate and political\nmatter; because it’s embarrassing for the CEO, it usually doesn’t happen.\nABA offers companies a human resources department for boards, allowing\nCEOs to outsource the management and tracking of the company board to the\nfirm. ABA establishes metrics for each board member (for example, three\nphone calls per month to open doors) and then tracks those metrics. If a board\nmember is not performing, and a difficult conversation is needed to push that\nmember out, ABA handles it, relieving pressure on the CEO.\nIn 2010, the world had 1.2 billion people online globally. By 2020, that\nnumber will reach five billion. Nearly three billion more people and their\nbrains will be available to work via smartphones, tablets or at Internet cafes.\nThe capabilities that will be unleashed are beyond imagination. Against this\nonslaught, what traditional organization, bogged down with permanent, full-\ntime employees, can endure?",

Now almost 55,000 members strong, this community has been\nable to design and build a drone that is very similar to the Predator drone\nused by the U.S. military (in fact, the DIY drone features 98 percent of the\nPredator’s functionality).But there’s one major difference: A Predator costs $4 million. The DIY\ndrone costs just $300.\nGranted, a great deal of that 2 percent difference in performance can be\nattributed to the weapons systems…bu t still, how is this possible?\nIt’s possible because Anderson has tapped into a large group of\npassionate enthusiasts who contribute time and expertise. “If you build\ncommunities and you do things in public,” he says, “you don’t have to find the\nright people, they find you.”\nThroughout human history, communities started off as geographically\nbased (tribes), became ideological (e.g., religions) and then transitioned into\ncivic administrations (monarchies and nation-states). Today, however, the\nInternet is producing trait-based communities that share intent, belief,\nresources, preferences, needs, risks and other characteristics, none of which\ndepend on physical proximity. For an organization or enterprise, its\n“community” is made up of core team members, alumni (former team\nmembers), partners, vendors, customers, users and fans. The “crowd” can be\nthought of as everyone outside those core layers.\nIt is important to note that an Exponential Organization interacting with its\ncommunity is not simply a transaction. True community occurs when peer-to-\npeer engagement occurs. The more open the community, though, the more\ntraditional and best-practice-oriented the leadership model has to be. As\nAnderson states: “At the top of every one of these communities is a\nbenevolent dictator.” You need strong leadership to manage the community,\nbecause although there are no employees, people still have responsibilities\nand need to be held accountable for their performances.Typically, there are three steps to building a community around an ExO:\nUse the MTP to attract and engage  early members. The MTP serves as\na gravitational force that attracts constituents into its orbit. Tesla,\nBurning Man, TED, Singularity University and GitHub are good\nexamples of communities whose members share common passions.\nNurture the community. Anderson spends three hours every morning\nattending to the DIY Drones community. Elements of nurturing include\nlistening and giving back. DIY Drones blueprints were open sourced and\navailable from day one, which was fine, but it turned out that the\nmembers really wanted DIY Drone Kits. So Anderson provided them.\n(The same DIY kit demand is occurring in the DIY biotech community).\nSmart move. “Unlike digital marketing, where ROI is sustained almost as\nsoon as spending happens, communities are a long-term investment that\nis significantly more strategic,” says social business thought leader Dion\nHinchcliffe. “Additionally, communities with CxO participation are far\nmore likely to be best-in-class.”\nCreate a platform to automate peer-to-peer engage ment. GitHub, for\nexample, has its members rate and review other members’ code. Airbnb\nhosts and users fill out evaluation forms; taxi disrupters Uber, Lyft and\nSidecar encourage clients and drivers to rate one another; and the news\nplatform Reddit invites users to vote on stories. In 2013, Reddit, which\nhas just fifty-one employees, most of whom manage the platform, saw\n731 million unique visitors cast 6.7 billion votes on 41 million stories.\nTalk about a platform…(More on this later.)\nTony Hsieh, CEO of Las Vegas-based Zappos , was inspired by the\nBurning Man community to combine both physical and trait-based\ncommunities within his Las Vegas Downtown Project. The project combines\nwork and play in an urban landscape with homes, infrastructure, hacker\nspaces, shops, cafe/theater and art. In addition to the goal of helping to\ntransform the downtown area into the most community-focused large city inthe world, Hsieh aims to create the smartest place on the planet by maximizing\nthe chances of serendipitous learning between Zappos  insiders and outsiders.\nThe result is not only a community built around common passions, but also\naround a common location.\nNote that in early stages, many companies find it easier to join an existing\ncommunity that shares its MTP. The Quantified Self movement, for instance, is\ndrawing together startups engaged in measuring all aspects of the human body .\nExamples of startups offering wearable technology that have banded together\nto form a community include Scanadu, Withings and Fitbit. As each startup\nfinds its path, of course, it is free to create its own community, particularly\nonce its user base is more significant.\nCrowd\nAs mentioned earlier, the crowd is made up of concentric rings of people\noutside the core community. The crowd is harder to reach, but its numbers are\nmuch greater—even a million times greater—and that’s what makes pursuing\nit particularly compelling.\nWhile similar, there is a distinct difference between Crowd and Staff on\nDemand. Staff on Demand is hired for a particular task and usually via a\nplatform like Elance. Staff on Demand is manage d—you tell workers what it\nis they have to do. Crowd, on the other hand, is pull-based. You open up an\nidea, funding oppor tunity or incentive prize…and let people find you.\nExOs can leverage the crowd by harnessing creativity, innovation, validation\nand even funding:Creativity, innov ation and the overall process of generating, developing,\nand communicating new ideas can be accomplished through the use of\ntools and platforms. Some platforms to aid this process include\nIdeaScale, eYeka, Spigit, InnoCentive, SolutionXchange, Crowdtap and\nBrightidea.\nValidation is achieved by obtaining measurable evidence that an\nexperiment, product or service succeeds in meeting pre-determined\nspecifications. Tools such as UserVoice, Unbounce and Google AdWords\ncan accomplish this.\nCrowdfunding is a growing trend to help fund ideas using the web to\nassemble very large numbers of comparatively small investors—thus not\nonly raising capital, but also reflecting the interest of the market. Two\nwell-known examples of crowdfunding companies are Kickstarter and\nIndiegogo. In 2012 there was an estimated $2.8 billion raised via\ncrowdfunding campaigns. By 2015 that number is expected to climb to\n$15 billion. The World Bank predicts crowdfunding to grow to $93\nbillion by 2025.\nIn addition to raising enormous amounts of money for causes and startups,\nsuch platforms are also democratizing access to working capital. Gustin, a\npremium designer jeans company, uses crowdfunding for all of its designs.\nCustomers back specific designs, and when a predetermined monetary goal\nhas been reached, the products are created and shipped to all backers. Gustin\nthus has no product risk or inventory costs.\nAlready, ExOs are leveraging community and crowd for many functions\ntraditionally handled inside the enterprise, including idea generation, funding,\ndesign, distribution, marketing and sales. This shift is powerful and taps into\nwhat university professor and social media guru Clay Shirky calls cognitive\nsurplus. “The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to",

As\na result, organizations are not only much more agile, they are also better at\nlearning and unlearning due to the diversity and volume of a flexible\nworkforce.

Ten\nyears later, its revenues had jumped 125x  and the company was generating a\nhalf-billion dollars every three days. At the heart of this staggering growth\nwas the PageRank algorithm, which ranks the popu larity of web pages.\n(Google doesn’t gauge which page is better from a human perspective; its\nalgorithms simply respond to the pages that deliver the most clicks.)\nGoogle isn’t alone. Today, the world is pretty much run on algorithms.\nFrom automotive anti-lock braking to Amazon’s recommendation engine; from\ndynamic pricing for airlines to predicting the success of upcoming Hollywood\nblockbusters; from writing news posts to air traffic control; from credit card\nfraud detection to the 2 percent of posts that Facebook  shows a typical user—\nalgorithms are everywhere in modern life. Recently, McKinsey estimated that\nof the seven hundred end-to-end bank processes (opening an account orgetting a car loan, for example), about half can be fully automated. Computers\nare increasingly performing more and more complex tasks.\nThere is even a marketplace called Algorithmia, where companies are\nmatched with algorithms that can potentially make sense of their data. Like\nGitHub (see Chapter Seven), developers can open up their code for others to\nimprove upon.\nIn particular, there are two types of algorithms that are at the frontier of\nthis new world: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\nMachine Learning is the ability to accurately perform new, unseen tasks,\nbuilt on known properties learned from training or historic data, and based on\nprediction. Key open source examples include Hadoop and Cloudera. An\nillustration of Machine Learning comes via Netflix, which in 2006 set out to\nimprove its movie recommendations. Rather than limit the challenge to its in-\nhouse workforce, Netflix launched a $1 million (incentive) competition with a\nstated goal of improving its movie-rating algorithm by 10 percent. The initial\n51,000 contestants, who hailed from 186 countries, received a dataset of one\nhundred million ratings and had five years to achieve the goal. The contest\nended early, in September 2009, when one of the 44,014 valid submissions\nachieved the goal and was awarded the prize.\nDeep Learning is a new and exciting subset of Machine Learning based\non neural net technology. It allows a machine to discover new patterns without\nbeing exposed to any historical or training data. Leading startups in this space\nare DeepMind, bought by Google in early 2014 for $500 million, back when\nDeepMind had just thirteen employees, and Vicarious, funded with investment\nfrom Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Twitter, Baidu, Microsoft\nand Facebook  are also heavily invested in this area. Deep Learning\nalgorithms rely on discovery and self-indexing, and operate in much the same\nway that a baby learns first sounds, then words, then sentences and even\nlanguages. As an example: In June 2012, a team at Google X built a neuralnetwork of 16,000 computer processors with one billion connections. After\nallowing it to browse ten million randomly selected YouTube video\nthumbnails for three days, the network began to recognize cats, without\nactually knowing the concept of “cats.” Importantly, this was without any\nhuman intervention or input.\nIn the two years since, the capabilities of Deep Learning have improved\nconsiderably. Today, in addition to improving speech recognition, creating a\nmore effective search engine (Ray Kurzweil is working on this within\nGoogle) and identifying individual objects, Deep Learning algorithms can\nalso detect particular episodes in videos and even describe them in text, all\nwithout human input. Deep Learning algorithms can even play video games by\nfiguring out the rules of the game and then optimizing performance.\nThink about the implications of this revolutionary breakthrough. The\ntechnology will make most products and services more effective,\npersonalized and efficient. At the same time, many white-collar jobs will be\nimpacted and even disrupted.\nGiven that the 55,000 trucks in UPS’s American fleet make sixteen million\ndeliveries daily, the potential for inefficient routing is enormous. But by\napplying telematics and algorithms, the company saves its drivers eighty-five\nmillion miles a year, resulting in a cost savings of $2.55 billion. Similar\napplications in healthcare, energy and financial services mean that we’re\nentering a world of Algorithms R Us.\nAs far back as 2005, writer and publisher Tim O’Reilly stated that, “Data\nis the new Intel Inside.” And that was when there were just a half-billion\nInternet-connected devices in the world. As we noted in Chapter One, that\nnumber is set to grow to a trillion devices as we prepare to embrace the\nInternet of Things.In the face of that explosion, the need for algorithms has become mission\ncritical. Consider for a moment that the last two years have seen nine times\nmore data created than in the entire history of humanity. Then consider that the\nComputer Sciences Corporation believes that by 2020 we’ll have created a\ntotal 73.5 zettabytes of data—in Stephen Hawking’s phraseology, that’s\nseventy-three followed by twenty-one zeros.\nRemarkably, and often tragically, most companies today are still driven\nalmost solely on the intuitive guesses of their leaders. They may use data to\nguide their thinking, but they are just as likely to fall prey to a long list of self-\ndelusions—everything from a sunk-cost bias to a confirmation bias (see\nbelow for a list of cognitive biases). One reason for Google’s success is that\nit is more ruthlessly data-driven than most other companies, right down to its\nhiring practices.\nIn the same way that today we can no longer handle the complexities of air\ntraffic control or supply chain management without algorithms, almost all the\nbusiness insights and decisions of tomorrow will be data-driven.\nAn analysis by the American Psychological Association of seventeen\nstudies on hiring practices found that a simple algorithm beat intuitive hiring\npractices by more than 25 percent in terms of successful hires. Neil\nJacobstein, an expert in Artificial Intelligence, notes that we use AI and\nalgorithms to mitigate and compensate for many of the following heuristics in\nhuman cognition:\nAnchoring bias: Tendency to rely too heavily, or “anchor,”\non one trait or piece of information when making\ndecisions.\nAvailability bias: Tendency to overestimate the likelihood of\nevents with greater “availability” in memory, which canbe influenced by how recent the memories are or how\nunusual or emotionally charged they may be.\nConfirmation bias: Tendency to search for, interpret, focus\non and remember information in a way that confirms\none’s preconceptions.\nFraming bias: Drawing different conclusions from the same\ninformation, depending on how or by whom that\ninformation is presented.\nOptimism bias: Tendency to be over-optimistic,\noverestimating favorable and pleasing outcomes.\nPlanning fallacy bias: Tendency to overestimate benefits\nand underestimate costs and task-completion times.\nSunk-cost or loss-aversion bias: Disutility of giving up an\nobject is greater than the utility associated with acquiring\nit.\nComplete list of all cognitive biases:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\nJacobstein is fond of pointing out that your neocortex has not had a major\nupgrade in 50,000 years. It is the size, shape and thickness of a dinner napkin.\n“What if,” he asks, “it was the size of a table cloth? Or California?”\nThere is an interesting difference of opinion over how much data should be\nused based on the nature of the market in which the organization operates.\nWhile conventional wisdom says to gather as much data as possible (hence\nthe term Big Data), psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer cautions that in uncertain\nmarkets, it is better to simplify, use heuristics and rely on fewer variables. Instable and predictable markets, on the other hand, he recommends\norganizations “complexify” and use algorithms with more variables.\nOne of the leaders in gleaning insights from massive amounts of data is\nPalantir. Founded in 2004, Palantir builds government, commercial and health\nsoftware solutions that empower organizations to make sense of disparate\ndata. By handling technical problems, Palantir liberates its customers to focus\non solving human ones. The venture capital industry considers Palantir so\nimportant that the company has already received an astounding $900 million\nin total funding, and is valued at 10x that amount.\nMichael Chui notes that many successful companies today had Big Data in\ntheir DNA. We believe it’s just the beginning, and that many more algorithm-\nfocused ExOs will pop up in the coming years, harnessing what Yuri van\nGeest calls the 5P benefits of big data: produc tivity, prevention,\nparticipation, pe rsonalization and prediction.\nTo implement algorithms, ExOs need to follow four steps:\n1. Gather: The algorithmic process starts with harnessing data, which is\ngathered via sensors or humans, or imported from public datasets.\n2. Organize: The next step is to organize the data, a process known as ETL\n(extract, transform and load).\n3. Apply: Once the data is accessible, machine learning tools such as\nHadoop and Pivotal, or even (open source) deep learning algorithms like\nDeepMind, Vicarious and SkyMind, extract insights, identify trends and\ntune new algorithms.\n4. Expos e: The final step is exposing the data, as if it were an open\nplatform. Open data and APIs can be used to enable an ExO’s community\nto develop valuable services, new functionalities and innovation layered\non top of the platform by remixing the ExO’s data with their own.",

In the business world, leasing\neverything from buildings to machinery has been used as a common practice\nto shift assets from the balance sheet.\nAnd while not owning assets has been standard practice for heavy\nmachinery and non-mission-critical functions (e.g., copiers) for decades,\nrecently there’s been an accelerating trend towards outsourcing even mission-\ncritical assets. Apple, for example, leverages the factories and assembly lines\nof Foxconn, its manufacturing partner, for key product lines. In the case of\ncounterexamples—such as Tesla owning its own factories or Amazon owning\nits own warehouses and local delivery services—the underlying reason isn’t\nfinancial; instead, the driving force is the scarcity of mission-critical\nresources involved, or that it’s so new that it’s now fully fleshed out.The information age now enables Apple and other companies to access\nphysical assets anytime and anywhere, rather than requiring that they actually\npossess them. Technology enables organizations to easily share and scale\nassets not only locally, but also globally, and without boundaries.\nAs we noted earlier, the launch of Amazon Web Services in March 2006\nwas a key inflection point in the rise of ExOs. The ability to lease on-demand\ncomputing that would scale on a variable cost basis utterly changed the IT\nindustry.\nA new Silicon Valley phenomenon called TechShop is another example of\nthis trend. In the same way that gyms use a membership model to aggregate\nexpensive exercise machinery that few could afford to have at home,\nTechShop collects expensive manufacturing machinery and offers\nsubscribers a small monthly fee ($125 to $175, depending on the location) for\nunlimited access to its assets.\nTechShop is neither small-time nor a novelty. The popu lar Square\npayment device, for example, was prototyped at TechShop. Square’s inventor\ndidn’t have to buy expensive machinery to build his prototype—he simply\njoined TechShop and leveraged the on-demand assets. Square now processes\nmore than $30 billion annually in transactions and is valued at more than $5\nbillion. Established companies such as GE and Ford are also working with\nTechShop. Ford launched a new TechShop location in Detroit in 2012, and\ntogether the two companies created Ford’s Employee Patent Incentive\nProgram. Some 2,000 Ford employees joined the program, resulting in a 50\npercent increase in patentable ideas. GE, in conjunction with TechShop,\nSkillshare and Quirky, launched a similar initiative last year in Chicago\ncalled GE Garages.\nAs with Staff on Demand, ExOs retain their flexibility precisely by not\nowning assets, even in strategic areas. This practice optimizes flexibility and\nallows the enterprise to scale incredibly quickly as it obviates the need forstaff to manage those assets. Just as Waze piggybacked off its users’\nsmartphones, Uber, Lyft, BlaBlaCar and Sidecar leverage under-utilized cars.\n(If you own a car, it sits empty about 93 pe rcent of the time.)\nThe latest wave of non-asset businesses is something called Collaborative\nConsumption, a concept evangelized by Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers in\ntheir book , What’s Mine is Yours: The Rise of Collabor ative Consumption.\nThe book pushes the sharing philosophy forward by establishing information-\nenabled assets of all kinds, from textbook s to gardening tools to housing—\nassets and resources that are abundant and widely available. Research\nconducted by Crowd Companies in April 2014 highlights the industries in\nwhich seventy-seven of the largest organizations in this new economy operate.\nAs shown in the chart below, retail, transportation and technology are\ncurrently the biggest industries.\n",

The truth is this:\nconnected individuals can now do what once only large\ncentralized organizations could. The effects of which are seen in\nevery Exponential Organizational example.

So the\nquestion for leaders is how do you enable, foster, organize,\ngalvanize and act on that fundamental human capacity to\ncontribute and work with others?\nKey attributes of Engagement include:\nRanking transparency\nSelf-efficacy (sense of control, agency and impact)\nPeer pressure (social comparison)\nEliciting positive rather than negative emotions to drive long-term\nbehavioral change\nInstant feedback (short feedback cycles)\nClear, authentic rules, goals and rewards (only reward outputs, not\ninputs)\nVirtual currencies or points\nProperly implemented, Engagement creates network effects and positive\nfeedback loops  with extraordinary reach.

However, these\ntechniques can also be used internally with employees to boos t collaboration,\ninnovation and loyalty.For the Millennial generation, gaming is a way of life. Today, more than seven\nhundred million people around the world play online games—159 million in\nthe U.S. alone—and most play for more than an hour each day. The average\nyoung person racks up more than 10,000 hours of gaming by the age of twenty-\none. That’s almost exactly as much time as kids spend in the classroom\nthroughout middle school and high school. Gaming isn’t just something that\nyoung people do, it is a large part of what and who they are.\nThese numbers help explain why AI researchers are using gaming to help\nthem map the human brain. The only problem is that it takes an AI-assisted\nresearcher fifty hours to reconstruct just one neuron in 3D. The brain has 85\nbillion neurons—which means it would take 4,250 bi llion hours to completely\nmap the human brain. That’s 485.2 million years. Rather linear, wouldn’t you\nsay?\nTo solve this problem and speed up the process, EyeWire—which was\nspun out of MIT and launched in December 2012—h as created a game in\nwhich players color 2D pieces to form 3D pieces as they simultaneously\nreconstruct neurons. This very simple task for a very difficult problem has\nalready resulted in 130,000 pe ople from 145 c ountries mapping more than one\nhundred neurons.\nEyeWire illustrates how an ExO can apply game elements and mechanics\nin non-game products and services to create fun and engaging experiences,\nconverting users into loyal players—and in the process accomplish\nextraordinary things. Other games that use this technique include MalariaSpot\n(hunt malaria parasites in real images), GalaxyZoo (classify galaxies\naccording to their shapes) and Foldit (help biochemists combat AIDS and\nother diseases by predicting and producing protein models).\nAs game designer and author Jane McGonigal sees it, “Human beings are\nwired to compete.”Engaging gamers, however, requires more than just throwing a game up on\na website and letting gamers have at it. “Gamification should empower\npeople, not exploit them. It should feel good at the end of the day because you\nmade progress towards something that mattered to you.”\nTo be successful, every gamification initiative should leverage the\nfollowing game techniques:\nDynamics: motivate behavior through scenarios, rules and progression\nMechanics: help achieve goals through teams, competitions, rewards\nand feedback\nCompone nts: track progress through quests, points, levels, badges and\ncollections\nGamification is not only used to tackle challenges and problems with the help\nof a community, it can also be used as a hiring tool. Google is famous for\nusing games to qualify potential hires, and Domino’s Pizza created a video\ngame called Pizza Hero in which the goal is to make the perfect pizza neatly\nand quickly. Customers can create their own pies and then order them, and top\npizza makers are encouraged to apply for jobs.\nAnother use of gamification is to improve a company’s internal culture.\nKarl M. Kapp researched this topic in his book , The Gamification of\nLearning and Instruction Fieldbook : Ideas Into Practice. One example he\ncites is that of Pep Boys, a large car repair and maintenance retail store that\nhas over seven hundred locations in thirty-five states and generates $2 billion\neach year. Despite its profit margins, the company found that it suffered from\nmany safety-related incidents and injuries each year, many of them a result of\nhuman error. It also found that theft was becoming an increasing problem. To\nincrease awareness of the issues, Pep Boys implemented a platform calledAxonify, which used a quiz to educate employees about specific incidents.\nCorrect answers earned the employees prizes; incorrect answers resulted in\nadditional information and testing until the material was fully mastered. The\nplatform achieved a voluntary participation rate of over 95 percent, and even\nas the number of stores and employees increased over time, safety incidents\nand claim counts fell more than 45 percent, and theft and human errors\ndroppe d 55 percent. As safety became a top focus at Pep Boys, its culture\ncompletely shifted.\nGamification initiatives can be created from the ground up (as illustrated\nby EyeWire), but there are also many startups and companies providing\nservices that an organization can simply adopt and leverage, just as Pep Boys\ndid with Axonify. The Gamification Company provides a list with more than\nninety examples, including Badgeville, Bunchball, Dopamine and Comarch.\nOrganizations can also use work.com (a Salesforce company), in which\ngamification is fully integrated, or Keas, which was specifically created to\nimprove employee wellness.\nIncentive competitions are another form of engagement that has been recently\npopu larized by the X Prize Foundation and others. This engagement technique\nis typically used to find promising people in the crowd and move them into\nthe community. Competitions are also used to challenge, leverage and\nmotivate the community in order to solicit potentially radical breakthrough\nideas. For Peter Diamandis, it all started with the Ansari X Prize, which\nrewarded $10 million to the first non-government organization to launch a\nreusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. Twenty-six\nteams from around the world participated, and contestants included everyone\nfrom hobby ists to large-corporation-backed teams. In November 2004,\nMojave Aerospace Ventures won the prize with its SpaceShipOne spacecraft.Virgin Galactic is currently using the successors to this design to enable\ncommercial space flight, which will cost $250,000 a ticket and is planned for\nthe end of 2014.\nAfter the success of the Ansari X Prize, more X Prizes were created. One\nof X Prize’s current offerings is the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which will\naward $10 million to the first team whose handheld medical diagnostic\ndevice outperforms ten board-certified physicians. Currently, twenty-one\nteams are competing for the grand prize. The recently launched X Prize\nspinoff HeroX takes this model even further, allowing companies to create\ntheir own challenges through the HeroX platform to solve local and global\nchallenges.\nAn incentive prize creates a clear, measurable and objective goal, and\noffers a cash purse for the first team to reach that objective. The advantage\nsuch competitions offers is their ability to deliver huge leverage and\nefficiency. Incentive prizes are also tools that can be used by individuals,\nstartups, governments, and medium and large corporations, but they are unique\nin that they allow small teams or lone innovators to launch or transform\nindustries. By tapping into the deep-rooted human desire to compete, these\ncompetitions push teams to deliver their very best work. In most cases,\nincentive competitions have stretch goals embedded within them as well,\nmeaning they require breakthrough thinking and revolutionary products to win.\nPerhaps the most important side effect of incentive competition is the\nperipheral innovation it creates as numerous competitors race towards a\ncommon goal. Such innovations can galvanize a company or an entire industry,\nspurring it forward at an unprecedented pace. From 2008 to 2011, Yuri van\nGeest and Vodafone Netherlands (later on, Vodafone Group) created and ran\nthe world’s largest mobile Internet startup contest, Vodafone Mobile Clicks,\nwith prizes exceeding $300,000.  The competition launched in the Netherlands\nand quickly grew to include a total of seven European countries. MobileClicks enabled Vodafone to engage not only with more than 900 mobile\nInternet startups, but also with the local mobile community in each of those\ncountries. In the process, what began as an external competition funneled into\nan internal interface that provided Vodafone with oppor tunities to fund and\nacquire ideas, identify talent and acquire candidates. Vodafone’s “contest”\nbecame a form of corporate venture capital, which morphed successfully into\nthe thriving Startupboot camp (SBC) startup incubator/accelerator program\nacross Europe.\nIncentive competitions are hardly new—after all, Charles Lindberg’s solo\nnonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 was in pursuit of just such a\nprize; in fact, his biography inspired Peter Diamandis to create the X Prize.\nAnother well-known incentive program designed to increase engagement is\nthe longstanding “Employee of the Month” program. Until recently, however,\nincentive programs have rarely been used to motivate creativity and\nproductivity within communities and crowds.\nAnother positive side effect of engagement, particularly when it comes to\ngamification, is training. The complexity of some of today’s games provides\nan excellent education in leadership and teamwork skills. In fact, Joi Ito has\nobserved that becoming an effective World of Warcraft guild master is\ntantamount to a total-immersion course in leadership.\nIndeed, what might seem like the least serious tool in a company’s user\nand employee engagement program often proves to be one of its most\npowerful in terms of finding and training the individuals it needs to reach the\nnext level.\nAlthough a comparatively minor issue as far as traditional enterprises are\nconcerned, engagement proves to be critical for ExOs. It is a key element for\nscaling the organization into the community and crowd and for creatingexternal network effects. No matter how promising its product or premise,\nunless an ExO is able to optimize the engagement of its community and crowd,\nit will wither and fade.\nWhy Important? Dependencies or Prerequisites\n• Increases loyalty\n• Amplifies ideation\n• Converts crowd to\ncommunity\n• Leverages marketing\n• Enables play and\nlearning\n• Provides digital\nfeedback loop w ith users• MTP\n• Clear, fair and consistent rules\nwithout conflicts of interest\nPassion and Purpose. We began this chapter by essentially asking two\nquestions: What gives an organization meaning? What compels employees,\ncustomers and even members of the general public to devote themselves to the\nsuccess of that enterprise? These questions become even more vital when\ndiscussing Exponential Organizations, given that their extraordinary rates of\ngrowth, combined with a heavy dependence on their communities to help them\nrealize their visions, demands a level of unprecedented commitment from a\nbroader set of stakeholders—individuals who traditionally have had only a\ntenuous connection to the enterprise.\nAlthough such commitment is often found with music groups and sports\nteams, it is seldom seen in the corporate world. There are, however, a few\ncorporate rock stars, the most famous of which is Apple. Apple’s army of\nmillions of true believers, who line up to buy its products, create blogs about\nthe company and products, place Apple stickers in the back windows of cars,and vociferously defend the company against heretics and apostates, is a\nparadigmatic example of a lively, complex and powerful corporate\ncommunity.\nObviously, creating such a community requires a great product and a\ncompelling vision. But it also demands a fair amount of time. It took eight\nyears after the introduction of the Macintosh for Apple Computer to become a\nphenomenon, and another sixteen years for the company to reach its status as a\ncultural icon.\nExponential Organizations don’t have that amount of time. Nor are they\nlikely to have a charismatic leader like Steve Jobs. Instead, they must move\nquickly and systematically, using proven techniques and tools. In this chapter\nwe’ve provided both: the MTP to elicit the passionate involvement of all\nstakeholders in a crusade to achieve a compelling larger vision; and the\ncomponents of SCALE to build and engage the Community & Crowd, to use\nStaff on Demand and Leveraged Assets, and to leverage Algorithms.\nAre these attributes perfect substitutes for charisma and genius? No. But they\nare a lot more available and much less subject to chance. They are also much\nmore manageable. Best of all, the combination of MTP and SCALE can be\napplied to any organization, small or large.\nNow that we have covered the external attributes of an ExO, in the next\nchapter we will examine the internal attributes to see how an organization\nmanages the chaos and keeps from breaking apart while running at such a high\nspeed.\nKey TakeawaysExponential Organizations have a Massive\nTransformative Purpose (MTP)\nBrands will start morphing into MTPs\nExOs scale outside their organizational\nboundaries by leveraging or accessing people,\nassets and platforms to maximize flexibility,\nspeed, agility and learning.\nExOs leverage five externalities (SCALE) to\nachieve performance gains:\nStaff on Demand\nCommunity & Crowd\nAlgorithms\nLeveraged Assets\nEngagementCHAPTER FOUR\nInside the Exponential Organization\nThe sheer output to be processed when SCALE elements are leveraged\nrequires that the internal control mechanisms of an ExO be managed carefully\nand efficiently. For example, an X Prize generates hundreds of ideas that need\nto be evaluated, catalogued, ranked and prioritized. With exponential output,\nthe internal organization needs to be extremely robust, precise and properly\ntuned to process all the inputs. As a result, Exponential Organizations are far\nmore than how they appear to the outside world, or how they behave with\ncustomers, communities and other stakeholders. They also have distinctly\ndifferent internal operations that encompass everything from their business\nphilosophies to how employees interact with one another, how they measure\ntheir performance (and what they value in that performance), and even their\nattitudes toward risk—in fact, especially their attitudes toward risk.\nAnd just as the external attributes of the Exponential Organization can be\nencompassed with the acronym SCALE, so too can an ExO’s internal\nmechanisms be expressed with the acronym IDEAS.\nInterfaces\nDashboards\nExperimentation\nAutonomy",

They are\nalgorithms and automated workflows that route the output of SCALE\nexternalities to the right people at the right time internally. In many cases,\nthese processes start out manual and gradually become automated around the\nedges. Eventually, however, they became self-provisioning platforms that\nenable the ExO to scale. A classic example is Google’s AdWords, which isnow a multi-billion dollar business within Google. A key to its scalability is\nself-provisioning—that is, the interface for an AdWords customer has been\ncompletely automated such that there is no manual involvement.\nIn the last chapter we introduced Quirky, a CPG company known for\nmoving a product from idea to store shelves in less than a month. The\ncompany leverages a community of more than a million inventors, each eager\nto get their ideas to market. As a result, Quirky has had to develop special\nprocesses and mechanisms to manage, rank, filter and engage that vast\ncommunity. Interfaces such as the one used by Quirky help ExOs filter and\nprocess outputs from external attributes (SCALE) in a systematic and\nautomatic way into the core organization. The use of Interfaces results in more\neffective and efficient processes, reducing the margin of error. While growing\nexponentially as a company, Interfaces are critical if an organization is to\nscale seamlessly, especially on a global level.\nThe same is true of other firms that coordinate data and oversee\neverything from prizes to personnel. Kaggle has its own unique mechanisms to\nmanage its 200,000 data scientists. The X Prize Foundation has created\nmechanisms and dedicated teams for each of its prizes. TED has strict\nguidelines that help its many “franchised” TEDx events around the world\ndeliver with consistency. And Uber has its own ways of handling its army of\ndrivers.\nMost of these Interface processes are unique and proprietary to the\norganization that developed them, and as such comprise a unique type of\nintellectual property that can be of considerable market value. ExOs invest\nconsiderable attention to Interfaces and a great deal of human-centered design\nthinking is brought to bear on these processes in order to optimize every\ninstantiation.\nAs these new processes evolve and become more powerful, they typically\nfeature both heavy instrumentation and the kind of metadata gathering thatfeeds the company’s Dashboards (which we will describe in the next section).\nUltimately, Interfaces tend to become the most distinctive internal\ncharacteristics of a fully realized ExO. There’s a good reason for this: at peak\nproductivity, Interfaces empower the enterprise’s management of its SCALE\nexternal attributes—in particular Staff on Demand, Leveraged Assets and\nCommunity & Crowd. Without such interfaces the ExO cannot scale, thus\nmaking them increasingly mission-critical.\nPossibly the most dramatic example today of an Interface is Apple’s App\nStore, which now contains more than 1.2 million apps that have been\ndownloaded a collective seventy-five billion times. Apple has about nine\nmillion developers within that ecosystem who have earned more than $15\nbillion.\nTo manage this unique environment, Apple’s Interface is comprised of an\ninternal editorial board that vets new applications and requested changes, as\nwell as recommendations from other employees, who make up an informal\nnetwork. New products and policies are announced at WWDC conferences,\nand Apple uses a sophisticated algorithm to help determine which apps are\nleading their categories and which should be featured on the home page. As\nmight be expected, this process is unique to Apple, as are most interfaces at\nExOs. They are not taught at business schools, and there are no pundits talking\nabout how to go about building them. Nonetheless, they are the core levers by\nwhich any ExO can manage to scale.

While most processes are optimized around scarcity and\nefficiency, SCALE elements generate large result sets, meaning Interfaces are\ngeared towards filtering and matching. As an example, keep in mind that the\nNetflix prize generated 44,104 entries that needed to be filtered, ranked,\nprioritized and scored.\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Filter external abundance into • Standardized",

A regional hub would then tally the results for multiple stores a few days\nlater. Several weeks after that, a buyer at the head office would look over the\ntotals and determine how many boxes of Pampers the company needed to\norder for its next bulk purchase.\nWalmart blew this model apart—and in the process revolutionized\nretailing—by  launching its own geostationary satellite and then tracking\ninventory and supply chain transfers in real time. It crushed the competition by\nconsistently outperforming other chains by 15 percent—a staggering\ncompetitive margin in retail. Sears and Kmart never fully recovered.\nThere has always been a tension in business created by the need to\nbalance instrumentation and data collection versus running the company and\ngetting things done. Collecting internal progress statistics takes time, effort\nand expensive IT. That’s why results were usually tracked annually or, at best,\nquarterly.\nToday’s startups (as well as more mature enterprises) are leveraging\nwireless broadband, the Internet, sensors and the cloud to track this same data\nin real time. Will Henshall, founder and CEO of the fascinating startup\nfocus@will, which streams anti-distraction music and sounds to help users\nfocus, has instrumented his business almost completely. Embedded into his\noperations are the following metrics, which he tracks in real time:\nTotal users\nNew guests within last day\nTotal number of Personal Users\nNew Personal User registrations within last day\nPercentage of New Personal Users vs. new Guests within last day\nTotal Pro Subscribers\nNew Pro Subscribers within last dayPercentage of New Pro Subscribers vs. new Personal Users within last\nday\nTotal cash receipts\nCash receipts within last 30 da ys\nCash receipts within last day\nTo a corporate executive from just twenty years ago this would be an\nastounding list of measurements—almost beyond imagination. But the quality\nof this list is even more impressive than its quantity. It offers metrics about\ncustomer behavior every bit the equal of information stored in the head of an\nold-time storekeeper about the needs and wants of each of his small-town\npatrons—bu t on a global scale. And the amount of information stored will\nonly grow each year, even as the Big Data analytics to process it improve\nover time.\nAnd there’s more. Today we are seeing a different approach to gathering\ndata than in the past. Traditional vanity metrics (stats such as the number of\nvisitors or mobile app downloads) are being replaced by real value metrics\nincluding repeat usage, retention percentage, monetization and Net Promoter\nScore (NPS). This emergent focus on real value KPIs is being built into the\npopu lar new Lean St artup movement (see Experimentation).\nEven as the instrumenting of businesses accelerates, a similar\ntransformation is also taking place at the level of individual employee and\nteam performance tracking. The dreaded annual performance review is\ndemotivating for most employees, and is especially so for high achievers\nbecause of the long delay between accomplishment and recognition. During\nthat interval, top employees are at risk of becoming frustrated, bored, and\nmoving on—costing fast-growth companies the employees they can least\nafford to lose.In response, many ExOs are adopting the Objectives and Key Results\n(OKR) method. Invented at Intel by CEO Andy Grove and brought to Google\nby venture capitalist John Doerr in 1999, OKR tracks individual, team and\ncompany goals and outcomes in an open and transparent way. In High Output\nManage ment, Grove’s highly regarded manual, he introduced OKRs as the\nanswer to two simple questions:\n1. Where do I want to go? (Objectives)\n2. How will I know I’m getting there? (Key Results to ensure progress is\nmade)\nIn addition to Intel and Google, other fast-growth companies using the\nsystem include LinkedIn, Zynga, Oracle, Twitter and Facebook .\nIn operation, an OKR program, as its name suggests, operates along two\ntracks. An Objective, for example, might be to “Increase sales by 25 percent,”\nalong with “Form two strategic partnerships” and “Run AdWords campaign”\nas the desired Key Results. OKRs are about focus, simplicity, short(er)\nfeedback cycles, and openness. As a result, insights and improvements are\neasier to see and implement. In contrast, complexity, secrecy and broad goals\ntend to impede progress, often leading to unintended consequences. As Larry\nKeeley, president and co-founder of the innovation strategy firm Doblin\nGroup, says, “The truth is there are about 65 different metrics for innovation.\nNo company needs all 65. You need half a dozen. You need to pick the right\nhalf dozen contextually for whatever it is you’re trying to achieve\nstrategically.”\nSome characteristics of OKRs:\nKPIs are determined top-down, while OKRs are determined bot tom-up.Objectives are the dream; Key Results are the success criteria (i.e., a\nway to measure incremental progress towards the objective).\nObjectives are qualitative and Key Results are quantitative. OKRs are\nnot the same as employee evaluations. OKRs are about the company’s\ngoals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance\nevaluations—which are entirely about evaluating how an employee\nperformed in a given period—a re independent of OKRs.\nObjectives are ambitious and should feel uncomfortable.\n[In general, up to five objectives and four key results per initiative are\noptimal, and key results should see an achievement rate of 60 to 70\npercent; if they don’t, the bar has been set too low.]\nExOs have more than taken this technique to heart. Many are now\nimplementing high-frequency OKRs—that is, a target per week, month or\nquarter for each individual or team within a company.\nScientific results in neuroscience, gamification and behavioral economics\nhave shown the importance of both specificity and frequent feedback in\ndriving behavioral change and, ultimately, having an impact. Specificity and\nrapid feedback cycles energize, motivate and drive company morale and\nculture. As a result, a number of services, including OKR Hub, Cascade,\nTeamly and 7Geese, have been formed to help businesses track these\nmeasures.\nThat said, there is still a long way to go, especially beyond the world of\nhot startups, and this is true of even the world’s high tech centers. Fabio\nTroiani, managing director of Business Integration Partners, a global\nconsultancy based in Italy, obs erves that OKRs are still unique even to Silicon\nValley. He reports that of the hundred large corporations in Europe and South\nAmerica with which he’s familiar, none use OKRs.Meanwhile, dashboards of value metrics, used in conjunction with OKRs, are\nbecoming the de facto standard for measuring ExOs—everything from the\ncompany as a whole to individual teams and employees. At Google, for\nexample, all OKRs are completely transparent and public within the company.\nFurthermore, younger-generation employees have experienced different\nconditioning in terms of measurements and feedback loops  than have older\ngenerations. For example, embedded within the highly popu lar game of World\nof Warcraft are dashboards similar to OKRs and Lean metrics with short\nfeedback cycles.\nA good analogy for the benefit of fast-cycle OKRs is mobile phones. Over\nthe last fifteen years, the instant email and always-on connectivity provided\nby mobile phones has drastically improved decision-making speed and\nconversation cycle times. OKRs do the same for organizations.\nWhy are dashboards key for ExOs? Because growing at a rapid pace\nrequires that instrumentation of the business, individual and team assessments\nbe integrated and carried out in real time, not least because small mistakes\ncan grow very big very fast. Without both functions in place, a company is\nliable to drift back to its earlier focus on “vanity” metrics and lose attention\nor have misguided KPIs for teams. Or both.\nAs mentioned at the start of the chapter, tight control frameworks are\ncritical to managing hyper growth. Real time dashboards and OKRs are key\nelements of that control framework.\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Track critical growth drivers in\nreal time\n• OKRs create control framework\nto manage fast growth• Real time metrics\ntracked, gathered and\nanalyzed\n• OKRs implemented",

        "contents": "• Minimize exposure from errors\nbecause of short feedback loops• Cultural acceptance by\nemployees\nExperimentation\nWe define Experimentation as the implementation of the Lean Startup\nmethodology of testing assumptions and constantly experimenting with\ncontrolled risks. According to Zappos  CEO Tony Hsieh, “A great brand or\ncompany is a story that never stops unfolding.” That is, it is imperative to\ncontinuously evolve and experiment. Bill Gates takes Hsieh’s insight a step\nfurther: “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they\ncan’t lose.”In a recent commencement address at Singapore Management University,\nJohn Seely Brown made the compelling point that all corporate architectures\nare set up to withstand risk and change. Furthermore, he said, all corporate\nplanning efforts attempt to scale efficiency and predictability, meaning they\nwork to create static—or at least controlled-growth—environments in the\nbelief that they will reduce risk.\nBut in today’s fast-changing world, Seely Brown continued, just the\noppos ite is true. Mark Zuckerberg agrees, noting, “The biggest risk is not\ntaking any risk.” Constant experimentation and process iteration are now the\nonly ways to reduce risk. Large numbers of bottom-up ideas, properly\nfiltered, always trump top-down thinking, no matter the industry or\norganization. Seely Brown and Hagel call this “scalable learning,” and given\nthe growth rates of ExOs, it is their only possible strategy. In the best cases,\nExOs feature both—that is, ideas are developed bottom-up and get\nacceptance/ratification/support from the top. In the end, the best ideas win,\nregardless of who propos ed them.\nIn an effort to kick-start this kind of thinking, Adobe  Systems recently\nlaunched the KickStart Innovation Workshop. Participating employees receive\na red box containing a step-by-step startup guide and a pre-paid credit card\nwith $1,000 in seed money, and are given forty-five days to experiment with\nand validate innovative ideas. Although they have access to coaching from\nsome of the company’s top innovators, the rest is up to them. In 2013, nine\nhundred of Adobe ’s 11,000 employees participated in the workshop. Not only\ndoes Adobe ’s approach stimulate experimentation, but it also establishes a\nmeasurable funnel by which promising ideas and concepts can be identified\nand pursued in a systemic and comparable way.\nMany other companies are also exploring experimentation—not just in\nskunkworks, but also on core processes. It is not, however, a totally new\nconcept. The Japanese have long followed the practice of kaizen: constantimprovement as a fundamental process management technique. The only\ndifference between scalable learning and kaizen is the use of new and more\nadvanced offline and online data-driven tools to test assumptions of customer\ngroups, use cases and solutions.\nApple used a kind of kaizen to launch its first retail store, which was\nconsidered a highly risky move at the time. After bringing Millard Drexler,\nCEO of Gap Inc., onto its board, Apple then hired Ron Johnson (who as vice\npresident of merchandising made his name elevating Target’s image above\nthat of a high-end Kmart) to manage the new retail operations. With their\ncollective knowledge, the two men prototyped a store, then tested and\nredesigned it based on customer data and feedback. Apple kept iterating until\nit had enough validation to roll out its first Apple Store in northern Virginia on\nMay 15, 2001. Once the concept became successful, Apple scaled it\naggressively; the company currently has 425 r etail stores in sixteen countries.\nThis technique is popu larly known as the Lean Startup movement, which\nwas created by Eric Ries and Steve Blank and is based on Ries’s book  of the\nsame name. The Lean Startup philosophy (also known as the Lean Launchpad)\nis in turn based upon Toyota’s “lean manufacturing” principles, first\nestablished a half-century ago, in which the elimination of wasteful processes\nis paramount. (Sample principle: “Eliminate all expenses with any goal other\nthan the creation of value for the end customer.”)The Lean Startup concept was also given impetus by Steve Blank’s book ,\nThe Four Steps to the Epiphan y, which focuses on customer development.\n(Sample concept: “We don’t know what the customer wants until assumptions\nare validated.”) The most important message of the Lean Startup movement is\nto “Fail fast and fail often, while eliminating waste.” Its approach can be\nsummarized as a new, scientific, data-driven, iterative, and highly customer-\ndriven approach to practical innovation that is used by startups, mid-marketcompanies, corporations and even governments. To illustrate how this credo\ncan have such a positive impact on a company, compare it to the traditional\nmethod of  product development, also known as the waterfall model.\nAs mentioned in Chapter Two, the traditional waterfall approach to\nproduct development is a linear process (most often referred to as NPD, for\nNew Product Development) that uses sequential steps such as idea generation,\nscreening, product design, development and commercialization. This process\nnot only burns up a great deal of precious time but, more importantly,\nincreasingly results in new products that don’t fit—or, because the market is\nchanging so quickly, no longer fit—the needs of the customer, culminating in a\nproduct no one wants. Inevitably, even more time and money is spent adapting\nthe product to fit the customer, a process that once again takes too long as the\nmarket moves on.\nIn the end, of course, the product fails. In sum, NPD has become a process\nin which thinking and doing are separated for a long time period and where\ndata-driven and behavioral customer feedback is delivered too late in the\ndevelopment process. As Nassim Taleb explains, “Knowledge gives you a\nlittle bit of an edge, but tinkering (trial and error) is the equivalent of 1,000 I Q\npoints. It is tinkering that allowed the Industrial Revolution.”\nBy comparison, consider the same scenario using the Lean Startup\nmethod:\nThe company first researches the needs of the customer, then conducts an\nexperiment to see if a propos ed product matches those needs. By relying on\nquantitative and qualitative data, a company forms a conclusion based on a\nseries of well-considered questions:\nDoes a product fit the need of the customer?\nHow did a customer solve a problem or need in the past?\nWhat are the current costs created by the customer problem?Should we adapt or change our course?\nAre we ready to scale?\nThis process of constant learning can be accomplished in just a couple of\nweeks or months, at minimal cost. Best of all, it usually becomes clear early\non if a product is doom ed to failure. A good way of looking at this is that\nwhen you move from point A to point B, you can then see point C. But you\ncan’t see point C from point A. Iteration/experimentation is the only way.\nAs Eric Ries explains, “The modern rule of competition is whoever learns\nfastest, wins.” Most digital markets are winner-takes-all markets due to\nnetwork effects. This makes a culture of continuous experimentation even\nmore important.\nThe Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship uses a Lean Startup\nprocess for corporate innovation that is similar to the one used at Adobe . It’s\ncalled the 5x5x5x5 method (5). Five corporate teams with five\ncomplementary team members compete for five weeks (one to two days a\nweek), spending no more than $5,000 to produce one innovation. The budget\nis ideal for testing assumptions with real customers related to the customer\ngroup, customer problem (use case), and solution (innovation concept) using\ndifferent offline and online methods.\nAfter five weeks, each team presents its output, which is a combination of\nconcept, competitive analysis, business model canvas and validated learning\nbased on different experiments or Minimal Viable Products (MVPs). In short,\nit is a data-driven, scientific, problem-solution fit and product-market fit for\nthe innovative idea that maximizes learning and speeds up the product\ndevelopment process—bot h key requirements for a rapidly changing world.\nNot bad for little more than one month’s work.\nMaria Mujica, who heads up the two-year-old innovation unit Fly Garage\nfor Mondelez International, a confectionery company, uses Experimentation to4run several-day “Garages” to create new brand engagements. Groups of free\nthinkers from inside and outside the organization are invited to participate in a\nno-boundary environment. The following steps constitute a “Garage”\nexperience:\nDetox by disconnecting and unplugging from everything\nEmpathize and immerse so as to connect with the oppor tunity\nBoil ideas down to a creative brief (brief then transcribed onto a T-shirt\nthat’s worn)\nAgitate to drive ideation and mix/shake up solutions\nPrototype rapidly to enable a fast user experience\nFascinating outcomes have resulted from Garages, including the “Traffic\nKaraoke in Bogota” and a vending machine where users pay with hunger\n(which is measured by a swallowed sensor). Fly Garage is successfully\nbalancing corporate procedural repeatability with highly creative outcomes—\na holy grail for any organization. Mujica has also mastered another\ntraditionally difficult balance: top-down direction with bottom-up creativity\nand little or no cultural tension.\nA final and critical pre-requisite for experimentation is a willingness to fail.\nThirty years ago, Regis McKenna, a Silicon Valley marketing pioneer, was the\nfirst to note that whatever its reputation for success, the Valley was in fact\nbuilt on failure—or more precisely, a willingness to accept and even reward\n“good”  failure.\nUnfortunately, within the traditional corporate environment, failure more\noften than not still results in career-level consequences due to long lead times\nand large investments. This, of course, reduces risk appetite. At the same\ntime, sunk-cost bias (the momentum that attaches to projects solely because ofthe money already invested) also kicks in. Before long, a company can find\nitself spending even more money launching a doom ed product despite clear\ndata that it will fail. Remember the Iridium mobile phones case? The Navteq–\nWaze case? In addition, consider the well-known NASA motto: “Failure is\nnot an option.” Although noble and inspiring, it was ultimately a death knell\nfor exploration. When failure is not an option, you end up with safe,\nincremental innovation, with no radical breakthroughs or disruptive\ninnovations.\nBy integrating experimentation as a core value and adopting approaches\nlike Lean Startup, enterprise failures—while still accepted as an inevitable\npart of risk—can be quick, relatively painless and insightful. Google, for\nexample, is particularly good at experimentation: If a product is not meeting\nits goals, and resources could be better leveraged elsewhere, the product is\nshut down. Recriminations are limited, the company quickly moves on and the\nemployees involved never experience career-limiting consequences.\nSome corporations have even taken to celebrating failure in order to\ncounteract what they see as a cultural resistance among their employees to the\nvery idea of failure. For example, the Procter & Gamble Heroic Failure\naward honors the employee or team with the biggest failure that delivered the\ngreatest insight. Similarly, Tata offers an annual Dare To Try award, which\nrecognizes managers who took the biggest risk. In 2013 alone, the award\nattracted more than 240 e ntries.\nThis doesn’t mean, of course, that just any failure or mistake is\nencouraged or celebrated. But if a team is operating within strategic,\ncommercial, ethical and legal frameworks and avoids recreating old mistakes,\na failure can and should be celebrated for the learning such experimentation\noffers. A well-known Silicon Valley credo holds that it is crucial to\ndistinguish a “good”  failure, one done for all of the right reasons and that\nproduces useful results, from a “bad” one—and even from a “bad” success,where success is more luck than accomplishment—and then to reward\naccordingly.\nNot only does failure free people, ideas and capital for future learning and\nbreakthroughs, it’s also worth noting that, though rarely recognized, a\ncorporate culture that accepts failure benefits from diminished internal\npolitics and much less in the way of pointing fingers and “blame games”\nthanks to trust, transparency and ope nness.\nThere are some limitations to the Lean Startup approach, including lack of\ncompetitor analysis or considerations in design thinking. Also, it is important\nto note that the ability to fail is much easier in software and information-based\nenvironments because iteration is so much easier. For a hardware company,\nit’s much harder to iterate. Apple launches hardware only when it’s perfect.\nYou wouldn’t want to iterate and fail fast when building a nuclear reactor.\nAs Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer state in their new book , The Innov ator’s\nMethod: Bringing the Lean Start-up into Your Organization: “Don’t try to\nscale it until you nail it.”\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Keeps processes aligned with\nrapidly changing externalities\n• Maximizes value capture\n• Faster to market (MVP)\n• Risk taking provides an edge and\nfaster learning• Measurement and\ntracking of experiments\n• Cultural acceptance\n(failure=experience)",

        "name": "Autonomy",
        "contents": "Autonomy\nWe describe Autonomy as self-organizing, multi-disciplinary teams\noperating with decentralized authority. Valve Software, a game company, is a\nmost unusual enterprise. It has 330 staffers but no classic management\nstructure, reporting lines, job descriptions or regular meetings. Instead, the\ncompany hires talented, innovative self-starters, who decide which projects\nthey wish to join. They are also encouraged to start new projects, so long as\nthey fit the company’s MTP. Autonomy is a prerequisite for permissionless\ninnov ation.\nExtreme autonomy—relying on small, independent, multi-disciplined\nteams—has worked well for Valve. It has a higher revenue-per-employee\nnumber than any other gaming company, and its approach enables changing\nroles and activities for all workers. This organizational style also creates asociable, open and trusting culture featuring a highly satisfied staff. In fact, the\ncompany is confident enough in its way of doing business that its employee\nmanual is open sourced and available to anyone, including competitors.\nValve isn’t alone in pioneering new organizational models in order to amp\nperformance. Its approach to autonomy is similar to the MIT Media Lab: both\nare passion-driven organizations in which employees and students are self-\nstarters who launch their own projects or pick from a collection of ongoing\nprojects. Some projects are even begun with external partners for the sole\npurpose of collaborating on innovative ideas.\nIn perhaps the most extreme case of Autonomy, Philip Rosedale, founder and\nformer CEO of Second Life and founder and CEO of High Fidelity, has made\nit a practice at High Fidelity to have his employees vote each quarter on\nwhether or not to keep him on as CEO. In addition, instead of relying on\nemployee reviews, share options are allocated on an anonymous peer-to-peer\nbasis.\nFrom teleworking to outsourcing to flattened, virtual organizations, there\nhas been a clear and steady trend toward increased autonomy in the\nworkplace. As a result, we predict the lightweight OKR approach will\ngradually replace traditional top-down managerial oversight. Furthermore,\nmany Exponential Organizations are organizing internally—though not in\ntraditional departments with layers of middle management, but rather by self-\norganized, interdisciplinary teams and with radically decentralized authority.\nThe Millennial generation, armed with Internet and gaming skills, which\ncultivate a self-starter and entrepreneurial mindset, is increasingly at odds\nwith classic hierarchical structures that are optimized for efficiency over\nadaptability.Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar Animation Studios and president of Pixar\nAnimation and Walt Disney Animation, expands on this idea in his New York\nTimes bestselling book , Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces\nThat Stand in the Way of True Inspiration: “We start from the presumption\nthat our people are talented and want to contribute. We accept that, without\nmeaning to, our company is stifling that talent in myriad unseen ways. Finally,\nwe try to identify those impediments and try to fix them.”\nThe need for autonomy and decentralization is further driven by\nincreasingly critical and knowledgeable consumers who expect zero latency\nservice and delivery, and are quick to complain on review sites if their ever-\nclimbing expectations are not met. One survey by McKinsey found that after\nexperiencing poor customer experience, 89 percent of consumers switched\ntheir business to a competing company. On the flip side, 86 percent said they\nwere willing to pay more for better customer experience. These hypercritical\nand demanding consumers can only be satisfied with companies placing their\nmost empowered and proactive employees on the front line.\nA good example of this trend towards Autonomy is a company called\nHolacracy, which has taken Agile techniques from the software world and the\nLean Startup approach and extended them to all aspects of the organization.\nHolacracy (a concept as well as the company’s name) is defined as a social\ntechnology or system of organizational governance, in which authority and\ndecision-making are distributed via fractal, self-organizing teams rather than\nbeing vested at the top of a hierarchy. The system combines Experimentation,\nOKRs, ope nness, transparency and Autonomy.\nThe following table compares traditional organizational characteristics\nwith autonomous organizations like those advoc ated by Holacracy:\nWithout Holacracy With Holacracy\nCentral control and Distributed control and authorityauthority\nPredict and plan for long\ntermDynamic and flexible: changes can\nand are constantly occuring\nHierarchic structure OR\nflat, based on consensusNeither, as everyone is the ‘highest\nauthority’ in their own role and\n‘follower’ of other roles\nInterest oriented Core goal oriented\nTension as a problem Tension as fuel\nReorganization and\nchange managementNatural development, evolution and\nmovement\nJob titles Dynamic roles\nHeroic leaders,\nemployees and process\nsupervisorsVital people who fulfill their role\nOrganizing people Organizing work\nInstrumental use of human\nrelationships to serve\nOrganizational goalsClear separation between people,\nrelationships and roles\nHolacracy is said to increase agility, efficiency, transparency, innovation\nand accountability within an organization. The approach encourages\nindividual team members to take initiative and gives them a process by which\ntheir concerns or ideas can be addressed. The system of distributed authority\nalso reduces the burden on leaders to make every decision alone.\nImportantly, Autonomy does not imply a lack of accountability. As\norganizational design expert Steve Denning explains it: “There are still\nhierarchies in a network, but the hierarchies tend to be competence-based\nhierarchies, relying more on peer accountability than on authority-based\naccountability—that is, accountability to someone who knows something,\nrather than to someone simply because they occupy a position, regardless ofcompetence. It is a change in the role of the manager, not an abolition of the\nfunction.”\nThe following shows some enterprises at the cutting edge of organizational\nautonomy:\nMedium (2012)  – 40 e mployees\nMarket: Content platform. Medium is a new Internet site\nwhere people can share ideas and stories in more than\n140 c haracters. Not just for friends.\nHow is the company organized? Medium has no people\nmanagers and emphasizes maximum autonomy. Key\ncomponents at Medium are:\n• Tension resolution (identify issues and resolve them\nsystematically).\n• Organic expansion (employees can hire personnel if a\njob de mands it).\n• Decision-making power distributed and consensus\nseeking discouraged.\nWhat is the financial impact? Recent investment in 2014,\nvaluing the company at $250 m illion.\nZappos .com (1999)  – 4,000 e mployees\nMarket: Online retail market for shoes and clothing\nHow is the company organized?\n• Company places great emphasis on company culture and\ncore values.\n• Zappos pays people to leave if they don’t fit into thecompany culture.\n• Employees encouraged to go beyond traditional\ncustomer service.\n• Representatives encouraged to make decisions on their\nown.\n• No job standards available.\nWhat is the financial impact? In November 2009,\nZappos .com was acquired by Amazon.com in a deal\nvalued at $1.2 billion on the day of closing. Gross sales\nexceeded $1 billion in 2008 (20 percent better than the\nyear before) and 75 percent of its customers are repeat\nbuyers. Company profitable since 2006.\nValve Corp (1996)  – 400 e mployees\nMarket: Game development\nHow is the company organized?\n• Company has no managers.\n• Every employee has the freedom to create without\nhaving to worry about the consequences of failure.\n• Employees are encouraged to select and work on their\nown projects.\n• Employees are responsible for go/no go of projects and\nfor hiring personnel.\nWhat is the financial impact? Over 75 million active users\non the social entertainment platform. $2.5 billion equity\nin 2012.\nMorning Star Company (1970)  – 400 t o 2,400 e mployees (more\nduring harvest)Market: Agribusiness and food pr ocessing (tomato)\nHow is the company organized?\n• No supervisory management.\n• Employees are encouraged to innovate independently,\ndefine job responsibilities themselves, make equipment\npurchasing decisions.\n• Employees negotiate and set individual responsibilities\nwith fellow workers.\n• Compensation is peer-based.\nEach employee crafts a Colleague Letter of\nUnderstanding (CLOU), which outlines how worker will\nmeet the personal mission statement. Associates most\naffected by this person’s work must accept the CLOU\nbefore it goes into effect.\nWhat is the financial impact? The company has funded\nvirtually all its growth from internal sources, which\nsuggests it is robustly profitable. On the basis of its own\nbenchmarking data, Morning Star believes it is the\nworld’s most efficient tomato processor.\nFAVI (1960)  – 440 e mployees\nMarket: Designer and manufacturer of coppe r alloy\nautomotive components\nHow is the company organized? FAVI has no hierarchy or\npersonnel department, and there is no middle management\nor formal procedures. Teams are organized around\ncustomers. Each team is responsible not only for the\ncustomer, but for its own human resources, purchasing\nand product development.What is the financial impact? In 2010 FAVI generated a\nturnover of €75 million, 80 percent of it automotive. 38\npercent of personnel have been with the company for over\n15 years. Workforce grew from 140 t o 440.\nOther companies that have implemented autonomous structures include W.\nL. Gore & Associates, Southwest Airlines, Patagonia, Semler, AES,\nBuurtzorg and Springer.\nUniversity of Michigan economist Scott Page found that diverse teams are\nmore successful at answering complex questions than are homogenous groups\nor individuals, even if the homogenous groups and individuals are more\ntalented. His conclusion, however, shouldn’t be all that surprising. Charles\nDarwin discovered that evolution progressed fastest wherever small groups\nof a species isolated from the main popu lation adapted to stressful conditions.\nBy the same token, small, independent and interdisciplinary teams are critical\nto future organizations, especially at the edges.\nA final note: Approaches towards employee autonomy, like those found at\nHolacracy, are not just for small companies. Large organizations, including\nZappos  and Semler, have also adopted this structure across much bigger\noperations.\nHarvard professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter puts it best: “When dealing\nwith a rapidly changing environment and the fluid bou ndaries of business units\nthat come and go, more work will be done by crosscutting project teams, and\nthere will be more bottom-up self-organizing.”\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Increased agility\n• More accountability at customer\nface• MTP (as a gravity well)\n• Self-starting employees\n• Dashboards",

        "name": "Social Technologies",
        "contents": "• Faster reaction and learning\ntimes\n• Better morale\nSocial Technologies\nSocial technology is an overused industry buzz phrase that has been giving\nCIOs heartburn for the last decade. Regardless, however, it has had the effect\nof pushing old analog business environments to become more digital, low-\nlatency environments. Social technologies—whose analog counterpart, of\ncourse, is the so-called water cooler effect—create horizontal interactions in\nvertically organized companies.Social technology is finding fertile ground because the workplace has\nbecome increasingly digitized. It started with email, which provided\nasynchronous connectivity; next came wikis and intranets that provided\nsynchronous information sharing; today we have activity streams that provide\nreal-time updates throughout organizations. As Marc Andreessen said,\n“Communication is the basis for civilization and will be a catalyst and\nplatform in the future for more innovations in many industries.” The reason we\nthink this is important is the frame that social business expert Theo Priestley\nputs around it when he says, “Transparency is the new currency. Trust is the\nbill we’ll just be paying for.” Priestley’s equation for social business is:\nCONNECTION + ENGAGEMENT + TRUST + TRANSPARENCY.\nWhen it comes to advancing your business, J.P. Rangaswami, chief\nscientist at Salesforce, views social technology as having three key\nobjectives:\n1. Reduce the distance between obtaining (and processing) information and\ndecision-making.\n2. Migrate from having to look up information to having it flow through\nyour perception.\n3. Leverage community to build out ideas.\nFrom our perspective, Social Technologies are comprised of seven key\nelements: Social objects, Activity streams, Task management, File sharing,\nTelepresence, Virtual worlds and Emotional sensing.\nWhen implemented, these elements create transparency and connectedness\nand, most importantly, lower an organization’s information latency. The\nultimate objective is what the Gartner Group calls a zero latency enterprise\n—that is, a company in which the time between idea, acceptance and\nimplementation all but disappears—and implementing one can provide\nsignificant return on investment.Just how significant? Forrester Research studied one implementation of\nMicrosoft’s Yammer enterprise social network within a 21,000- employee\norganization. During a payback period of just 4.3 months, and with only one\nthird of the workforce using the product, the company saw an ROI of 365\npercent.\nGiven such results, it’s not surprising that Yammer now has 8 million\ninstallations. Similarly, Salesforce’s Chatter product grew from 20,000 active\nnetworks in February 2011 to 150,000 in less than eighteen months. Further,\nSalesforce’s data indicates that employee engagement among companies that\nadopt its platform increases by 36 percent and access to information speeds\nup 43 pe rcent.\nEmployee relationship management is just one type of social object that is\nbeing information-enabled. Also in the mix are location, physical objects,\nideas and knowledge—including updates to pricing data, inventory levels,\nmeeting room occupancy and even coffee refills. All are now being broadcast\ncompany-wide and are the basis of activity streams to which anyone in the\norganization can subscribe.\nTask management is also becoming increasingly social. In the past, it\nwas mostly used as a to-do list, but it is now shifting towards a more Agile\napproach. Teams are continuously measuring themselves by pushing codes\nand closing tickets, living by the metrics that task management software\nprovides. Asana, a software company founded by Dustin Moskovitz (a co-\nfounder of Facebook ) and Justin Rosenstein improves work productivity, and\nis based on the principle that “your to-do list should be just as addicting as\nyour Facebook  wall.”\nFile sharing, the fourth leg of the social stool, has recently enjoyed\nwidespread adoption. Tools, from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox  and\nMicrosoft’s OneDrive, are vital to sharing information and providing updates\nto a single instantiation of customer information. For example, Citibank oncehad more than three hundred different customer databases, each consuming\nvaluable overhead and costing enormous sums in duplication and redundancy.\nSuch drag on costs and operations is simply not acceptable in an Exponential\nOrganization—or, indeed, for any company trying to compete in the 21\ncentury.\nTelepresence has been around for many years in the form of\nvideoconferencing. Although videoconferencing was quite a hassle in the past,\nan organization can now leverage services such as Skype and Google\nHangout, which are fast, easy to use and available on every device.\nTelepresence enables employees to work proactively from any location and\ninteract on a global scale, reducing travel costs and improving well-being.\nEven greater improvement comes from Telepresence robots such as Beam,\nfrom Suitable Technologies, and Double Robotics, which leverage the user’s\ntablet. These robots even allow the user to be on multiple locations at once,\nwhich can greatly impact how to conduct business.\nWhile Telepresence lets people interact in a real environment, virtual\nreality allows interaction, collaboration, coordination and even prototyping in\na virtual world. Philip Rosedale’s Second Life is one of the best-known\nexamples: “One of the things about Second Life was that it enabled somebody\nlike IBM to basically set up a big get-together with a thousand people from\naround the world,” he says. Although Second Life didn’t fully meet customer\n(or investor) expectations and stoppe d growing after a few years, it has\nremained consistent, with one million people online every month and an\neconomy of $600 m illion in transactions.\nTo enable a fully immersive virtual world, Rosedale’s new High Fidelity\nplatform is leveraging hardware such as Oculus Rift, the PrimeSense depth\ncamera and the Leap Motion gesture controller. The High Fidelity\nenvironment has reduced the time lag between gesture and system response tostalmost the speed of human perception, resulting in a truly real-time\nexperience.\nEmotional sensing, the last key element of social technology, makes use\nof sensors—such as health sensors and neurotechnology—within a team or\ngroup to create Quantified Employees and a Quantified Workforce.\nEmployees will be able to measure everything about themselves and their\nwork, preventing illness, burnout and irritation, and also improving team\nflow, collaboration and performance. While work in the past was mostly\nfocused on the importance of the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the Emotional\nQuotient (EQ) and Spiritual Quotient (SQ) are now becoming increasingly\nimportant metrics as well.\nThe entire social paradigm presents several critical implications for\nExOs. Organizational intimacy is increased, decision latency is reduced,\nknowledge improves and is more widely spread, and serendipity increases. In\nshort, social technologies enable the real-time enterprise.\nFinally, the social paradigm also serves as a gravity force, keeping the\norganization tightly connected to its MTP and ensuring that its diverse parts\ndon’t drift away in pursuit of conflicting, even oppos ing, goals.\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Faster conversations\n• Faster decision cycles\n• Faster learning\n• Stabilizes team during rapid\ngrowth• MTP\n• Cloud social tools\n• Coope rative culture\nIf you remember our list of linear attributes of traditional organizations\nfrom way back in Chapter Two, we can now juxtapose linear versus\nexponential characteristics:Linear Organization\nCharacteristicsExO Characteristics\nTop-down and\nhierarchical in its\norganizationAutonomy, Social Technologies\nDriven by financial\noutcomesMTP, Dashboards\nLinear, sequential\nthinkingExperimentation, Autonomy\nInnovation primarily\nfrom withinCommunity & Crowd, Staff on\nDemand, Leveraged Assets, Interfaces\n(innovation at the edges)\nStrategic planning\nlargely an\nextrapolation from the\npastMTP, Experimentation\nRisk intolerance Experimentation\nProcess inflexibility Autonomy, Experimentation\nLarge number of FTEsAlgorithms, Community & Crowd,\nStaff on Demand\nControls/owns its own\nassetsLeveraged Assets\nStrongly invested in\nstatus quoMTP, Dashboards, Experimentation\nLet’s now look back at our definition of an ExO: “An Exponential\nOrganization is one whose impact (or output) is disproportionally large—\nat least 10x larger—compared to its peers because of the use of new\norganizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies.”As we have researched the paradigm, we have uncovered over sixty\norganizations with scores over our ExO threshold, each achieving at least a\n10x performance improvement over others in its space. The following are our\ntop 10 (in alphabetical order): Airbnb, GitHub, Google, Netflix, Quirky,\nTesla, Uber, Waze, Valve, Xiaomi.\nIt may seem odd to look back four centuries to capture the essence of the most\nmodern of company organizations. Nevertheless, Isaac Newton’s second law\nprecisely summarizes the overall concept of an Exponential Organization. The\nlaw, F = MA, states that force causes acceleration in inverse proportion to\nmass. A small mass allows dramatic acceleration and quick changes in\ndirection—precisely what we’re seeing with many ExOs today. With very\nlittle internal inertia (that is, number of employees, assets or organizational\nstructures), they demonstrate extraordinary flexibility, which is a critical\nquality in today’s volatile world.\nThis remarkable characteristic has been well demonstrated by Netflix. As\nmentioned earlier, the company offered a $1 million prize (Engagement) to\nanyone who could improve its rental recommendation program. What is less\nwell known is that Netflix never implemented the winning al gorithm.\nWhy? Because, tellingly, the market had already moved on. By the\nconclusion of the contest the industry had shifted away from rental DVDs;\nmeanwhile Netflix’s streaming video business was exploding and,\nunfortunately, the winning algorithm didn’t apply to streaming\nrecommendations. (Streaming was much less a matter of gathering the family\ntogether on a Friday night with popc orn than of having forty-five minutes at an\nairport to watch an episode of Mad M en.)Now, imagine that Netflix had invested the 2,000 hours the winning team\nspent on the project to develop that very same, now-obsolete algorithm. With\nprevalent sunk-cost biases and institutional insistence to see a return on that\ninvestment (plus the egos involved), there would have been enormous internal\npressure within the company to implement the algorithm, regardless of market\nrealities. As a result, Netflix might have not have altered course to become,\nprimarily, a streaming business—which, as we now know, would have been a\ndevastating mistake. But because the algorithm was developed externally,\nthere was much less corporate emotional attachment (i.e., mass) and inertia\n(force) to its implementation. Netflix was free to focus elsewhere, ultimately\nallowing it to evolve into the streaming content giant it has become.\nThe key question for any organization is not whether you “look” like an\nExponential Organization, but “How exponential are you?” That is, how much\nhave you internalized the philosophy of being an ExO? How does it inform\nyour daily operations in terms of autonomy and social technology? How\nefficiently do you use the right tools, from dashboards to interfacing? And\nhow open are you to risk, to experimentation and even to failure?\nThese are questions you need to ask yourself—not just once but every\nmonth or even week. That’s what it takes to be become, and remain, an\nExponential Organization.\nKey Takeaways\nExOs manage the abundant output of SCALE\nexternalities with guidance from their MTP and\nthe control framework of five internal IDEAS\nelements:Interfaces\nDashboards\nExperimentation\nAutonomy\nSocial Technologies\nThe more assets and workforce you have, the\nharder it is to switch strategies and business\nmodels.

Initially, it was due to little more\nthan an abundance of natural lighting. But soon there was a second reason.\nThe West Coast was far removed from the traditional culture of the East, and\nwith its almost unlimited cheap real estate and pliant local government, the\nearly film barons were free to do almost anything they wanted, including\nwriting their own rules.\nThe result was the studio system, in which early filmmakers set out to\nown the entirety of their assets and their workforces, from the sets to the\nstudios to the employees. Even actors were contracted to single studios, and\ndistribution was exclusive to the theaters owned by that studio.\nThis strategy quickly built one of the most valuable industries on the\nplanet. But as the decades passed, inefficiencies and antitrust issues crept in,\nand by the 1960s , the studio system was all but dismantled. What replaced it\nwas a system that was almost the exact oppos ite of what came before.",

        "contents": "Today, Hollywood operates in exactly the same loosely coupled,\nnetworked environment of an ExO ecosystem. Each participant, from the\nwriter and actor, to the director and camera grip, manages his or her own\ncareer. Meanwhile, agents at every level help find and connect scripts with\ntalent, production companies and equipment. These days, when a film is\ncreated, a swarm of independent entities come together for the duration of the\nproduction, operating on 24/7 schedules and in close collaboration. Once the\nfilm is finished, sets are broken down for re-use, equipment is reassigned and\nall the actors, grips and production assistants disband and scatter to pursue\ntheir next projects, which often start the very next day.\nHollywood didn’t plan this metamorphosis; rather, it evolved into an\nExO-like ecosystem because it is the nature of film to be a series of discrete\nprojects. The filmmaking process itself has always been characterized by a\nsingular combination of high density, close proximity and loosely coupled\nconstituents. These factors made Hollywood a pioneer in the virtualization of\nenterprises and now, combined with new social and communications\ntechnologies, puts it in the vanguard of the rise of the Exponential\nOrganization.\nThe high-tech startup ecosystem of Silicon Valley is another example of\nthis model: entrepreneurs, employees, scientists, marketers, patent lawyers,\nangel investors, venture capitalists and even customers—all operate within a\nsmall geographic region of the San Francisco Bay Area. Another (more\ndysfunctional) example is Wall Street.\nLeveraged by new generations of technology that, thanks to Moore’s Law,\nhave emerged every few years, the infrastructure is now in place for many\nindustries to move to this framework—and they will, not only because it\nconfers enormous competitive advantage, but also because it rewards first\nmovers.",

        "name": "1. Information Accelerates Everything",
        "contents": "In this chapter, we’ll examine in depth some of the characteristics of an\nExO ecosystem. In particular, we’ve identified nine key dynamics at play:\n1. Information Accelerates Everything\nEverywhere you look, the new information paradigm, created as a result\nof Moore’s Law and other fundamental forces that bear upon the digital\nworld, is accelerating the metabolism of products, companies and industries.\nIn industry after industry, the development cycle for products and services\ngrows ever shorter. And like the shift from film photography to digital\nphotography, once you change the substrate from a material, mechanical basis\nto a digital and informational one, the match is lit for an inevitable explosion.\nIn 1995 , 710 million rolls of film were developed at thousands of\nprocessing centers. By 2005, nearly 200 billion digital photographs, equaling\nabout eight billion rolls, had been taken and edited, stored and displayed in\nways that were unimaginable just a few years before. Today, web users\nupload almost one billion photographs per day to sites like Snapchat,\nFacebook  and Instagram.\nAs we saw in Chapter One, the shift from analog to digital is occurring in\nmultiple core technologies that feature multiplier effects at their intersections.\nThis process of “virtualizing” one industry after another is not just advancing\nexponentially, but at multiples of even that as data about the many different\ncomponents of a single item or process is systematically analyzed and\nautomated by software (data analytics). And that’s just the beginning: as we\nadd trillions of sensors on every device, process and person, the process will\naccelerate even faster to an almost unimaginable pace (Big Data). Finally,\naccording to Ericsson Research, within the next eight years we will see thenext generation of mobile networks (5G) sporting speeds of five gigabits per\nsecond. Just imagine what that will make possible.\nWhen Marc Andreessen proclaimed in a 2011 Wall Street Journal article\nthat “software is eating the world,” he was addressing this very phenomenon.\nAndreessen, who helped invent the Internet browser and is now one of Silicon\nValley’s most powerful venture capitalists, argued that in every industry, and\nat every level, software is automating and accelerating the world. Cloud\ncomputing and the app store ecosystems are clear testaments to this trend,\nwith the Apple and Android platforms each hosting more than 1.2 million\napplications programs, most of them crowdsourced from customers.\nNowhere is this staggering pace of change more apparent than with the\nconsumer Internet. Many products are now launched early—unfinished and in\nperpetual beta—for the sole purpose of gathering data from users as early as\npossible to determine how to “finish” the product. Data collected from these\nearly users is quickly analyzed for insights on bugs that need fixing and the\nfeatures users most want to see. Once the changes are implemented, the\nproduct is rereleased and analyzed…a nd the process continues.\nAs LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has said, “If you’re not embarrassed\nby the product when you launch, you’ve launched too late.”\nThese days, product development cycles are measured not in months or\nquarters, but in hours or days. The Lean Startup movement, with its paradigm\nof constant iteration/experimentation, began on the Toyota car production line\nin the 1970s , moved to the Internet in the 1990s , and is today showing that it is\napplicable to almost any type of business.\nA great example of this new approach is Wercker, a delivery software\ndevelopment platform based in Holland. Wercker helps developers reduce\nrisk and eliminate waste by continuously testing and deploying code using\nadvanced testing and debugging techniques. Wercker’s goal is to free the\nindividual developer to focus on the code and the application, where suchattention is most valuable, rather than on tedious install processes or systems\nmanagement.\nThe open source movement has further accelerated this trend. A single\ndeveloper working on, say, a printer driver, can now benefit from the\ntransparency of a hundred other developers who’ve worked on similar\nprojects. And that’s just the beginning: when network effects kick in, the\noverall community begins learning at a much-accelerated pace. We can see\nthis happening in web-hosted developer communities such as GitHub and\nBitbucket.\nThis information acceleration isn’t just confined to software development.\nIt is also happening in the hardware world. Consider Illumina, a biotech\ncompany that pioneered the development of high-speed genome sequencing\nmachines. In 2008, Illumina’s products sold for $500,000 each, plus as much\nas an additional $200,000 a year in consumable supplies to keep the machines\nrunning. Meanwhile, the product development cycle for new models was\neighteen months.\nThat eighteen-month product development cycle was particularly bad\nnews. Why? Because the pace of change (driven by the new information basis\nof the genome) in the industry was so fast that the shelf life of any new design\nwas just nine months. Which meant that even while Illumina’s sales team was\nselling one version of the company’s gene sequencer, two future versions of\nthe same machine were at different points in the development cycles.\nThe cost of having three generations of technology either in inventory or\ndevelopment was enormous for everyone involved. Then, a new open source\ncommunity appeared on the scene. Called OpenPCR, it was dedicated to\nbuilding a DNA-copying machine for just $599. This was analogous to the\nHome Brew club hobby ists creating the first PCs that then revolutionized\ncomputing. The result has been an industry-wide transformation, allowingnew entrants and hobby ists into the field, which has benefitted all players in\nthe business, including Illumina.\nThough few industries have experienced such a stunning transformation as\nbiotech, similar trends can also be seen in many other hardware arenas. Thus,\nwhile a basic 3D printer in 2007  cost nearly $40,000, the new Peachy Printer\n—recently funded on Kickstarter—is now available for just $100. And that’s\nonly the start: Avi Reichental, CEO of market leader 3D Systems, sees no\nobstacles to bringing his company’s high-end 3D printers to market for just\n$399 w ithin the next five years.\nAnother example of this trend includes single-board computers for\nrobotics and education, where the open sourced Raspberry Pi platform has\nproved transformative. The same is true of single-board controllers, where\nArduino has assumed dominance. No surprise, then, that one of the most\npopu lar new memes in the computer business is that “hardware is the new\nsoftware.” Dan Barry, a former astronaut who now builds robots, notes that\nwhenever he gets stuck on a robot configuration or sensor problem, he posts a\nquestion online before he goes to bed, waking the next morning to finds\nanswers from tens of thousands of robot enthusiasts.\nThis “going digital” is fundamentally shifting the competitive landscape in\nmany sectors, allowing new entrants from unexpected places. In some\ncountries, banks are getting into the travel business. We’re also seeing travel\nagents moving into insurance and retailers into media (Amazon, Netflix). As a\nresult, whatever business you are in, chances are your competitors are not\nwhat they used to be.\nA final outcome of this trend is that we seem to be entering an era of\n“winner-takes-all” markets. There’s really only one search engine (Google),\none auction site (eBay) and one e-commerce site (Amazon). Network effects\nand customer experience lock-in seem to be at the root of this fundamental\nchange in the nature of competition.",

        "contents": "2. Drive To Demonetization\nOne of the most important—and least celebrated—a chievements of the\nInternet during the last decade was that it cut the marginal cost of marketing\nand sales to nearly zero.\nBy this we mean that with the web, it is possible to promote an online\nproduct worldwide for a tiny fraction of what it cost just twenty-five years\nago. And, in concert with a viral referral loop, customer acquisition costs can\nalso be cut to what was once deemed impossible: zero. It is precisely this\nadvantage that allowed businesses such as Craigslist, eBay and Amazon to\nscale with extraordinary speed to become some the world’s biggest\ncompanies.\nThe virtual advantage of these companies devastated their competitors—\nin particular, the traditional print classified advertising business. Presented\nwith the option of free online classified ads as oppos ed to paid newspaper\nads, consumers flocked to sites like Craigslist and eBay. As a result, in 2012,\nnewspaper revenue fell to $18.9 billion, its lowest annual level since the\nNewspaper Association of America began tracking the data in 1950. Unable\nto compete with free, many newspapers have gone out of business, while\nothers have faded to a shadow of their former selves.\nThis revolution is still underway. Recently, the French startup Free has\nbegun offering mobile service supported by a large and active digital\ncommunity of brand advoc ates. The company cultivates highly connected\nopinion leaders who interact with the rest of the base via blogs, social\nnetworks and other Internet channels, thus building a wave of buzz that quickly\nspreads across the digital landscape. Although Free’s marketing budget is\nrelatively low, the company has gained substantial market share and achieved\nhigh levels of customer satisfaction.What’s important to understand is that in the age of the Exponential\nOrganization, the new information-enabled technologies will power\nexponential cost drops not just in sales and marketing, but also across every\nbusiness function.\nIn a 2003 Harvard Business Review article entitled “One Number You\nNeed to Grow,” Fred Reichheld introduced the concept of a Net Promoter\nScore (NPS), which measures the loyalty that exists between a provider and a\nconsumer. An NPS can be as low as −100 (everybody  is a detractor) or as\nhigh as +100 (everybody  is a promoter). An NPS that is positive (i.e., higher\nthan zero) is considered good, a nd an NPS of +50 is excellent.\nThe NPS is largely based on a single, direct question: How likely is it\nthat you would recommend our company /produc t/service to a friend or\ncolleague ? If you have a high NPS, then your sales function is free. If you are\nusing peer-to-peer models, your service costs can also essentially be free.\nUsing crowdsourcing and community ideation (such as Quirky or Gustin),\nyour R&D and product development costs can also approach zero.\nAnd it doesn’t stop there. What we’re now seeing with ExOs—and this is\ntremendously important—is that the marginal cost of supply goes to zero.\nA case in point: it costs Uber essentially zero to add an additional car and\ndriver to its fleet. By the same token, Quirky can find its next consumer\nproduct for essentially zero. ExOs are able to scale their businesses with near\n100 percent variable costs, even in traditionally capital-expenditure-heavy\nindustries.\nThis advantage seems obvious when it comes to information-based or\ninformation-enabled sectors. But remember: every industry is becoming\ninformation-based, either by being digitized or by using information to\nidentify under-utilized assets (e.g., collaborative consumptions). With Airbnb,for example, the marginal cost of a new room to rent is essentially zero. Not\nso for Hyatt or Hilton. A key reason for this drop in marginal cost is that there\nis (relative) abundance of supply. As shown in their book  Abundanc e, Peter\nDiamandis and Steven Kotler argue that as technology brings us a world of\nabundance, access will triumph over ownership. By comparison, scarcity of\nsupply or resources tends to keep costs high and stimulates ownership over\naccess.\nToday, a trend known as Collaborative Consumption leverages the Internet\nand social networks to create a more efficient utilization of physical assets.\nThe following shows just some of the vertical markets affected by the\nphenomenon of moving from “possess” to “access”: bartering, bike sharing,\nboat sharing, carpooling, ride sharing, car sharing, collaborative workspace,\nco-housing, co-working, crowdfunding, garden sharing, fractional ownership,\npeer-to-peer renting, product service systtem, seed swaps, taxi shares, time\nbanks, virtual currency (Source: Wikipedia).\nNote that in traditional industries that can be fully information-enabled,\nnew competition has produced a staggering drop in revenues for old\ncompanies. The business models for music, newspapers, and book  publishing\nhave all suffered through this transformation, and today look almost nothing\nlike they did ten years ago. Thus, the newspapers that have survived have\nlargely shifted their revenue efforts to their web pages; the albums and CDs of\nthe music industry have atomized to the selectable singles world of MP3 files;\nand many of today’s bestsellers enjoy most of their profits from e-book  sales.\nNote that today there is a whole category of the media industry—named\nfor the underlying physical media it’s been trying to sell—which is actually\nmade up of information businesses that have now been digitized. We believe\nthe television industry will be the next to fall to the information ax.",

        "contents": "3. Disruption is the New Norm\nIn his influential bestseller The Innov ator’s Dilemma, Clayton\nChristensen points out that disruptive innovation rarely comes from the status\nquo. That is, established industry players are rarely structured or prepared to\ncounter disruption when eventually it appears. The newspaper industry is a\nperfect example: it sat by for a decade as Craigslist systematically disrupted\nthe classified advertising model.\nToday, the outsider has all the advantages. With no legacy systems to\nworry about, as well as the ability to enjoy low overhead and take advantage\nof the democratization of information and—m ore important—technology, the\nnewcomer can move quickly and with a minimum of expense. Thus, new\nactors and entrants are well equipped to attack almost any market, including\nyours—along with your company’s profit margins.\nIndeed, the rate of change is so high everywhere these days that you now\nmust assume that someone will disrupt you, and often from a direction you\nleast expect. As Steve Forbes sees it, “You have to disrupt yourself or others\nwill do it for you.” This applies to every market, geography and industry.\nA century ago, competition was mainly driven by production. Forty years\nago, marketing became dominant. And now, in the Internet era, as production\nand marketing have been commoditized and democratized, it is all about ideas\nand ideals.\nMarketing has increasingly become product innovation—i.e., a good\nproduct sells itself. As young people and startups have plenty of ideals and\nideas, the competitive advantage—as well as the field of competition—\nmigrates towards their game and strong points. This is one of the key reasons\nwhy disruption today is more likely to come from startups than from existing\ndirect competitors.This pattern will take longer to impact older, capital-intensive industries\nsuch as oil and gas, mining and construction. But have no doubt: disruption is\ncoming. Consider that solar energy, which is powered by information\ntechnology, has been doubling in its price-performance every three years. In\nfact, in another four years, it’s estimated to reach grid parity in the U.S., when\nit will change the energy equation forever.\nMeanwhile, other traditional industries, including real estate and\nautomotive, are already succumbing to this new zeitgeist. The automobile\nindustry in particular has had its cage rattled by the emergence of the all-\nelectric Tesla. While the Tesla is a high-performance luxury car, it’s much\nmore than just that. In fact, in Silicon Valley, it is common to describe it is as\na computer that happens to move—and move very well. Who would ever\nhave predicted that in just three years a Silicon Valley team of (mostly)\nelectrical engineers would have created the safest car ever built? For one\nthing, they weren’t dragging 120 years of Iron-Age automotive history behind\nthem like an anchor, as Chevrolet was when it designed the Volt, a plug-in that\nrelies on a traditional gas engine to power a generator that charges the battery.\nThe result is indeed no-range anxiety, but the Volt power train is very complex\n—and expensive.\nWe see a consistent set of steps around disruptive innovation comprising the\nfollowing:\nDomain (or technology) becomes information-enabled\nCosts drop exponentially and access is democratized\nHobby ists come together to form an open source community\nNew combinations of technologies and convergences are introduced\nNew products and services appear that are orders of magnitude better\nand cheaper",

Raymond McCauley,\nBiotechnology & Bioinformatics Chair at Singularity University, has noticed\nthat “When people want a biotech job in Silicon Valley, they hide their PhDs\nto avoid being seen as a narrow specialist.”\nSo, if experts are suspect, where should we turn instead? As we’ve\nalready noted, everything is measurable. And the newest profession making\nthose measurements is the data scientist. Andrew McAfee calls this new\nbreed of data experts “geeks.” He also sees the HiPPO, or “highest paid\nperson’s opinion” as the natural enemy of geeks because HiPPOs still base\ntheir opinions largely on intuition or gut feeling. We don’t believe that this is a\ncontest that should be won completely by one side or the other. Instead, we\nthink that when it comes to ExOs, both groups will co-exist—bu t with a\nproviso: the role of HiPPOs (or experts) will change. They will continue as\nthe best people to answer questions and identify key challenges, but the geeks\nwill then mine the data to provide the solutions for those challenges.\n5. Death to the Five-Year Plan\nOne of the hallmarks of large companies is the presence of corporate\nstrategy departments that formulate and publish five-year plans. These are\nmulti-year strategies that are suppos ed to outline a company’s long-term\nvision and goals. In fact, the primary function of many corporate developmentdepartments is simply to fill in the details of that vision and provide specifics\non planning, purchasing, HR and ope rations.\nFive-year plans used to be secret internal documents. In recent years,\nhowever, after recognizing the need to enlist suppliers and customers in their\ncrusades, there has been a trend among even old-line corporations—such as\nAmtrak, the United States Postal Service and Chrysler—to publicize their\nfive-year plans.\nMany established companies still consider transparency to be the height of\nprogressive business thinking. But the truth is that the five-year strategic plan\nis itself an obsolete instrument. In fact, rather than offering a competitive\nadvantage, it is often a drag on operations, as has been well documented in the\nseminal book  by Henry Mintzberg, Rise and F all of Strategic Planning.\nA few decades ago, it was feasible (and important) to plan out that far.\nCompanies made strategic investments by looking ahead a decade or more,\nand the five-year plan served as the central document outlining the\nimplementation details of those long-term strategic bets. However, in an\nexponential world, the five-year plan is not only unworkable, it is seriously\ncounterproductive—and the advent of ExOs signals its death.\nAll of this may seem counterintuitive. After all, as companies accelerate\nfaster and faster shouldn’t they need more forward surveillance as an early\nwarning system? Theoretically, yes. But the reality is that the future is\nchanging so quickly that any forward look is likely to produce false scenarios,\nso much so that today’s five-year plans have a high probability of offering the\nwrong advice. Consider TED and its launch of TEDx events. Imagine that\nChris Anderson had stood up in early 2009 and said, “Okay, folks, let’s do\nthis TEDx thing. We want to have several thousand such events in five years.”\nHe would have instantly lost the buy-in of his team because that many events\nwould have sounded bot h insane and impossible.Now, imagine if Anderson had asked Lara Stein, the guiding light for the\nTEDx brand, to actually develop a five-year plan for TEDx. A very\naggressive plan by Stein might have looked like this:\nEven that sounds crazy: almost 2,500 events in five years? No way. In\nlinear thinking, that goal is clearly a stretch, what Jim Collins and Jerry\nPorras termed a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) in their 1994 classic,\nBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionar y Companies. (As an aside,\nconsider that an MTP is a BHAG with purpose.)\nYet as we now know, over 12,000 TEDx events have been held within five\nyears, a figure that would have been inconceivable at the outset. Had\nAnderson and Stein presented even the 2,500- event goal, they would have\neither likely triggered a mutiny among the team or they’d have left a lot on the\ntable. Instead, they simply plunged in and let the community set the pace for\nTEDx. Indeed, Anderson, Stein and the team had no idea they could maintain\nsuch a torrid pace until they actually did so.\nIn short, a five-year plan is a suicidal practice for an ExO. If it doesn’t\nsend the company racing off in the wrong direction, it can present an\ninaccurate picture of what lies ahead, even in the right direction. The only\nsolution is to establish a big vision (i.e., an MTP), set an ExO structure intoplace, implement a one-year plan (at most) and watch it all scale while\ncourse-correcting in real time. That’s exactly what TED did, and that’s what\nthe winning companies of the future will do a s well.\nNow, we can’t talk about operating plans and decision making without\naddressing the bane of departmental or company strategy meetings. In their\nfascinating new book , Moments of Impact: How to Design Strategic\nConversations That Accelerate Change , Chris Ertel and Lisa Kay Solomon\noutline the elements of successful planning and strategic meetings and\ndecision-making within organizations to address a widespread problem: most\nplanning and strategic meetings are a failure. Ertel and Solomon boil it down\nto five distinct phases for any team planning session or strategic decision:\n1. Define your purpose\n2. Engage Multiple Perspectives\n3. Frame the Issues\n4. Set the Scene\n5. Make it an Experience\nMoments of Impact is an important guide for anyone interested in\nreducing the rash of mind-numbing, unproductive meetings and optimizing the\ntime that management spends together.\nThus, the near future, certainly for ExOs, sees five-year plans being replaced\nwith the following elements:\nMTPs for overall guidance and emotional enrollment.\nDashboards to provide real time information on how a business is\nprogressing.\nLeveraging “Moments of Impact” for clean, productive decision-making.\nA one-year (at most) operating plan that is connected to the Dashboard.",

Besides, being eaten alive by an upstart\ncompetitor is anything but relaxing.\nThis shift will, of course, be quite challenging for large organizations,\nwhich rely on drawn-out projections and tracking for planning and control\npurposes.\n6. Smaller Beats Bigger (aka Size Does Matter, Just\nnot the Way You Think)\nRonald Coase won the 1991 Nobel Prize in Economics for his theory that\nlarger companies do better because they aggregate assets under one roof and,\nas a result, enjoy lower transaction costs. Two decades later, the reach\ndelivered by the information revolution has negated the need to aggregate\nassets in the first place.\nFor decades, scale and size have been desirable traits in an enterprise. A\nbigger company could do more, the argument went, because it could leverage\neconomies of scale and negotiate from strength. That’s one reason why, for\ngenerations, business schools and consulting firms have focused on the\nmanagement and organization of extremely large companies. And Wall Street\nhas gotten rich trading the stock of giant companies, which often merge to\ncreate even more gigantic organizations.\nAll that is changing. In The Start-up of You, Reid Hoffman shows that\ntransaction costs are no longer an advantage and that each individual can (and\nshould) manage himself or herself as a business. Why? One reason is theunparalleled and unprecedented ability of a small team today to do big things\n—an ability that grows ever greater if the exponential technologies described\nin Chapter One are put to use. Both now and in the coming years, adaptability\nand agility will increasingly eclipse size and scale.\nA telling example is how Netflix, with its centralized DVD rentals and\nsmall footprint, easily outmaneuvered and eventually destroyed Blockbuster,\ndespite its 9,000 stores and distributed geographical assets. In the software\nworld, Salesforce.com, which operates 100 percent in the cloud, can adapt to\nchanging market conditions much faster than can competitor SAP, given that\nthe latter requires customized installations onsite.\nWe’ve already discussed Airbnb, which by leveraging its users’ existing\nassets, is now valued at more than the Hyatt Hotels chain worldwide. While\nHyatt has 45,000 employees spread out across its 549 properties, Airbnb has\njust 1,324, all located in a single office. Similarly, Lending Club, Bitcoin,\nClinkle and Kickstarter are forcing a radical rethinking of the banking and\nventure capital industries, respectively. (No retail outlets are involved in\nthese new financial tech startups.)\nRichard Branson’s Virgin Group is structured to maximize the benefits of\na small-form factor. Its global research center is home to the company’s R&D\ndepartment and a unit that spins out new businesses under the umbrella brand.\nThe Branson group now consists of more than four hundred companies, all\noperating independently. Collectively, they are worth $24 bi llion.\nAs Peter Diamandis has often noted, one key advantage of a small team is\nthat it can take on much bigger risks than a large one can. This can be seen\nclearly in the graph below—courtesy of Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media\nLab—w hich shows how startups are characterized by high upside potential\nand low downside, while large organizations are characterized by just the\noppos ite.In healthcare, we currently have no solution for the new strains of\nantibiotic-resistant superbugs showing up in hospitals, which the World\nHealth Organization considers an existential threat as we enter the post-\nantibiotic era. Neither do we have a way to block the onset of allergies and\nautoimmune diseases, which afflict more than a billion people worldwide.\nQuotient Pharmaceuticals, however, aims to change that by building on the\npioneering work of Dr. William Pollack, who in the early 1960s  developed\nthe first blocking human antibody  solution, which has protected over sixty\nmillion mothers and their babies from the dreaded Rh disease. The vaccine\nresolved mother-fetus blood incompatibility, which was responsible for tens\nof thousands of infant deaths per year in the U.S. alone. By leveraging the\nbody ’s own ability to fight, the Anaheim-based company already has a\nworking product that stops most superbugs in their drug-resistant tracks—and\nthis just four years after it decided to take on the challenge. A mind-boggling\nside effect is that their products can also cure most allergies; Quotient’s\nblocking antibodies control the immune cascade response, which is\nresponsible for allergies like hay fever and asthma. Incredibly, Quotient’s\nteam consists of only ten people. Significant reasons for the capability of this\nsmall team to cover so much immunological ground is the multidisciplinary\nbackgrounds of the key personnel and the vastly decreased cost of developingproducts. Quotient has high containment laboratories and pilot fractionation\nfacilities, which allows it to separate antibodies, develop products and test\nthem in days rather than years, all in-house. The company is bypassing\ndecades of effort and the hundreds of millions in capital normally needed in\nthe bio/pharmaceutical industry.\nA fundamental question we regularly hear is: How big can an ExO get? We\nthink the more important question is: What happens to an ExO after it grows\nup?\nWhile this new paradigm is still in its early days, preliminary indications\nare that when successful, ExOs will build on the leverage created by their\nexternalities and become platforms.\nBut that answer creates its own set of questions, the most germane of\nwhich right now is: How can ExOs leverage the benefits of SCALE elements\nlike crowdsourcing, community management, gamification, incentive\ncompetitions, data science, leveraged assets and staff on demand to become\nplatforms?\nWe believe the answer is that they will wire themselves into the\ninfrastructure and start enabling other ExOs to emerge from and operate off of\nthose platforms.\nPerhaps the earliest example of this platform model was Google. Its\nsearch prowess allowed it to scale quickly, and once the company hit critical\nmass, the AdWords platform enabled self-provisioning advertising platforms\nfrom which other companies could grow. Google in turn took its share by\ntaxing that growth. Facebook  was also successful at becoming a platform,\nrelying on its extraordinary market penetration and knowledge about its users\nto spawn such ExOs as Zynga and its recent mobile efforts. Amazon is another\nsuccess story, as is Apple’s App Store ecosystem, which is probably theclearest example of an ExO product becoming a platform. MySpace and\nFriendster, on the other hand, failed to become platforms.\nSo, the answer to the question of how big an Exponential Organization can\nget yields yet another, more precise, question: How quickly can you convert\nexponential growth into the critical mass needed to become a platform? Once\nthat happens there is no practical limit. It’s one big coral reef.\nFor example, as Uber scales, it is helping its drivers buy cars. Its pre-\npurchase of 2,500 Google cars will provide an enormous data surge it can\nturn into new services. Uber today already is a platform with a critical mass\nof drivers, which allows it to move horizontally and offer new services:\npostal, gift and grocery delivery, as well as limousine and even medical\nservices. All leverage Uber’s key retail and demand-driven positioning,\nresulting in nearly instant gratification using a smartphone, combined with an\noutstanding customer experience.\nImportantly, the platform must be symbiotic and serve the feeders as well.\nWe’re all familiar with the dramatic success of Rovio’s Angry Birds. What’s\nless known is that for Rovio, Angry Birds was its 53 game—the company\nhas been at it since the early 1990s . But when creating a game twenty years\nago, companies had to create bilateral agreements with 150 different mobile\nphone companies, each of which wanted 75 percent of the revenues. All\nfocus, time and energy went into the hell of negotiating with mobile telcos.\nOnce on the Apple platform, however, Rovio only had to contend with a\nsingle point of negotiations, freeing it up to focus on its games—a scenario we\nstrongly suspect the company prefers.\nNow that the asteroid of digitized information has hit, the global economy has\nchanged forever. The era of traditional, hierarchical market domination by\ndinosaur companies is coming to an end. The world now belongs to smarter,rd",

Rent, Don’t Own\nAn important mechanism empowering individuals and small teams\neverywhere is low-cost access to technology and tools.\nEmblematic of this new reality is cloud computing, which offers the\nability to store and manage massive amounts of information with unlimited\nprocessing, all on a cost-per-use basis requiring no upfront costs or capital\ninvestments. In practice, this makes memory almost free. The cloud also puts\nsmall companies on the same footing as—or even gives them an advantage\nover—big companies, which are burdened by expensive internal IT\noperations. In addition, the growing body  of innovative Big Data analytical\ntools will give all companies, big and small, unprecedented understanding of\ntheir markets and customers.\nWe’re seeing that same access to other tools elsewhere as well. As first\nprofiled in Chapter Three, TechShop makes expensive equipment, previously\navailable only to government agencies and large corporate laboratories,\naccessible to anyone.\nAn example: Richard Hatfield, CEO and founder of Lightning\nMotorcycles, wanted to set a motorcycle speed record. The motorcycle he\nneeded to do so, however, wasn’t on the market, so he built it himself at\nTechShop. To date, according to TechShop CEO and co-founder Mark Hatch,\nabout $6 bi llion worth of new products have been created at TechShop labs.It is estimated there are now hundreds of “fablabs” operating around the\nworld. Soon, every town and neighborhood will have one, meaning that any\nindividual or small team will be able to rent equipment and be as capital-\nempowered as an established corporation.\nA comparable transformation is taking place with biotech equipment.\nBioCurious, another Silicon Valley invention, is an open wetlab where\nenthusiasts take courses, use centrifuges and test tubes, and synthesize DNA.\nGenspace offers a similar resource in New York City.\nThis rent-not-own philosophy further extends the current craze of\ncollaborative consumption and the sharing economy. There’s less and less\nneed to own a factory, a laboratory or even a scientific tool. Instead, why not\nrent those assets, reducing up-front investment and leaving the ownership and\nmaintenance of state-of-the-art facilities to someone else? Further, given that\nthe control mechanisms offered by software and the Internet allow the\nmanagement of these capabilities at a distance, why build your own? Even\nApple essentially rents capabilities from Foxconn to manufacture its products.\nAnd Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, allows you to outsource your\nentire manufacturing cycle.\nFirst computing, then tools and manufacturing. Today, that same rent-not-\nown philosophy even encompasses employees. Individual “temps” are nothing\nnew, of course, but the concept now includes groups of temporary workers.\nOrganizations can rent staff on demand from Gigwalk and other companies\nwhen a large amount of work needs to be done quickly, relieving them of the\ntraditional, nightmarish practice of serial hiring and firing. In this instance,\nthere is no distinction between “rented” staff and the ExO attribute, Staff on\nDemand.\nBe it facilities, equipment, computing or people, the concept of renting\nrather than owning is a major factor contributing to an ExO’s agility and\nflexibility, and thus its success. This too can be seen as the culmination of a",

Over the decades business owners have steadily moved from\nviewing business through the lens of a balance sheet to instead focusing on\nP&L—that is, emphasizing the primacy of profits over ownership. Much of\nthis movement has grown out of the realization that the ownership of assets,\neven if mission-critical, is better handled by experts. So, in that sense, the rise\nof ExOs is a deepening of the specialization trend that started 10,000 years\nago: only focus on those areas in which you are really outperforming. This not\nonly maximizes profits, but in a world with pervasive digital reputational\nsystems, also sets your image at the highest possible level, as author Tyler\nCowen says in the title of his book : Average is Over.\nAirline operators used to build their own engines, an intricate and high-\nrisk operation. Then GE and Rolls Royce, both experts in manufacturing\nengines, began offering leasing programs. Today, airlines pay for engines by\nthe number of hours flown. In other words, something as expensive and\ncomplex as an aircraft engine has now become a rented, pay-as-you-go asset,\nrather than an expensive internal business unit.\nRolls Royce has even taken the process a step further. By installing\nhundreds of sensors in each of its engines, the company is now able to gather\nand analyze immense quantities of information about its engines while they\nare in use. In the process, of course, it is transforming itself into a Big Data\ncompany—and thus into an ExO. This trajectory, from ownership to access to\ndata analytics, can also be seen in numerous other vertical markets such as\nautomobiles and real estate.\n8. Trust Beats Control and Open Beats ClosedAs we saw with Valve software, autonomy can be a powerful motivator in\nthe age of the Exponential Organization. The Millennial generation is naturally\nindependent, digitally native and resistant to top-down control and\nhierarchies. To take full advantage of this new workforce and hang on to top\ntalent, companies must embrace an open environment.\nGoogle has done just that. As we outlined in Chapter Four, its Objectives\nand Key Results (OKR) system is fully transparent across the company. Any\nGoogler can look up the OKRs of other colleagues and teams to see what\nthey’re trying to achieve and how successful they’ve been in the past. Such\ntransparency takes a considerable amount of cultural and organizational\ncourage, but Google has found that the openness it engenders is worth any\ndiscomfort.\nTony Hsieh built Zappos  into a billion dollar company using this very\nsame philosophy. Everything at Zappos  is about customer service and\nopenness. Its publicly available and annually updated 500-page Culture Book\ndefines who and what the company is. According to David Vik, Zappos ’\n“company coach,” there are five key precepts to Zappos  that drive culture\nacross the organization:\nVision: What you’re doing\nPurpose: Why you do it\nBusiness model: What will fuel you as you’re doing it\nWow and uniqueness factors: What sets you apart from others\nValues: What matters to you\nThe control frameworks used by traditional organizations were devised\nbecause the longer (and slower) feedback loops  between management and\nteams often required considerable oversight and intervention. Over the last\nfew years, however, a new wave of collaborative tools has emerged to allow\nan organization to monitor each of its teams with little oversight and maximumautonomy. ExOs are learning to harness these capabilities and deliver self-\nmanagement—often with extraordinary outcomes—by  tracking data on a real-\ntime basis. An excellent example is Teamly, which combines project\nmanagement, OKRs and performance reviews with the power of an internal\nsocial network.\nAnother key reason that ExOs are implementing trust frameworks is that in\nan increasingly volatile world, predictable processes and steady, stable\nenvironments are now all but extinct. Anything predictable has been or will\nbe automated by AI or robots, leaving the human worker to handle exceptional\nsituations. As a result, the very nature of work is changing and requires more\ninitiative and creativity from every team member. At the same time, team\nmembers often wish their organizations had more trust in them. According to a\n2010 survey conducted for The Conference Board, a global business\nmembership and research association, only 51 percent of Americans said they\nwere satisfied with their bosses.\nIt is important to understand that open trust frameworks cannot be\nimplemented in isolation or simply by fiat. They are an important consequence\nof implementing Autonomy, Dashboards and/or Experimentation.\nOne of the reasons Facebook  has been so successful is the inherent trust\nthat the company has placed in its people. At most software companies (and\ncertainly the larger ones), a new software release goes through layers upon\nlayers of unit testing, system testing and integration testing, usually\nadministered by separate quality assurance departments. At Facebook ,\nhowever, development teams enjoy the full trust of management. Any team can\nrelease new code onto the live site without oversight. As a management style,\nit seems counterintuitive, but with individual reputations at stake—and no one\nelse to catch shoddy  coding—Facebook  teams end up working that much\nharder to ensure there are no errors. The result is that Facebook  has been able",

Everything is Measurable and Anything is\nKnowable\nThe first accelerometers (devices used to measure new motion in three\ndimensions) were the size of a shoebox and weighed about two pounds.\nToday’s model is now just four millimeters across and is found in every\nsmartphone on the planet.\nWelcome to the sensor revolution, one of the most important and least\ncelebrated technological revolutions taking place today. A BMW automobile\ntoday has more than two thousand sensors tracking everything from tire\npressure and fuel levels to transmission performance and sudden stops. An\naircraft engine has as many as three thousand sensors measuring billions of\ndata points per voyage. And as we mentioned in Chapter One, a Google car,\nwith its lidar (light radar) scanning the surrounding environment with sixty-\nfour lasers, collects almost a gigabyte of data per second per car.\nThis revolution is also impacting our human bodies. In 2007, Wired\nmagazine editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly created the Quantified Self (QS)\nmovement, which focuses on self-tracking tools. The first Quantified Self\nconference was held in May 2011, and today the QS community has more than\n32,000 m embers in thirty-eight countries.\nMany new devices have been spun out of this movement. One of them is\nSpire, a QS device that measures respiration. Singularity University alumnus\nFrancesco Mosconi is the chief data officer of Spire. The analytics and\nsoftware he has written are all about real-time feedback regarding breath andhow it relates to stress and focus—not unlike the way sensor feedback in a\nBMW’s traction control system reduces wheel slip.\nWith more than seven billion mobile phones in use globally, many\nequipped with a high-resolution camera, anything and everything can be\nrecorded in real time, from a baby’s first words to the events of the Arab\nSpring. Like it or not, we are hurtling towards a world of radical transparency\n—and being driven off the privacy cliff by trillions of sensors recording our\nevery move. Beyond Verbal, an Israeli company, can analyze the tonal\nvariations of a 10-second clip of your voice to determine mood and\nunderlying attitude with an 85 pe rcent certainty.\nNow, toss into this mix Google Glass, the smart eyewear that enables\nvideo or images to be recorded or transmitted in real time anywhere as\npeople move throughout their day. Next, add drones, which cost less than\n$100 and can be flown at a variety of altitudes, their 5-gigapixel cameras\ncapturing everything in the landscape below. And, finally, consider the\nseveral nanosatellite companies which are launching mesh configurations of\nhundreds of satellites into low Earth orbit, and which will provide real-time\nvideo and images anywhere on the planet. Given the staggering pace of\ntechnological innovation, the possibilities are endless.\nOn a much more intimate level, the human body  has approximately ten\ntrillion cells operating as an ecosystem of unimaginable complexity. For all\nthat intricacy, however, we usually track our health using just three basic\nmetrics: temperature, blood pressure and pulse rate. Now, imagine if we\ncould measure each one of those ten trillion cells—and not with just three\nmetrics, but with a hundred. What would happen if we could track the enzyme\nlevels in our bloods tream, kidneys and liver and correlate those levels in real\ntime with other metrics? What larger meta-factors that we never knew even\nexisted will emerge from these mountains of data?Laser spectroscopy, for example, is currently being used to analyze food\nand drink for allergens, toxins, vitamins, minerals and calories. Companies\nalready exploring this technology’s capabilities include Apple, SCiO by\nConsumer Physics, TellSpec, Vessyl and Airo Health. Before long, laser\nspectroscopy will be used as a medical and wellness indicator, as well as to\nmeasure and track everything in our bodies, including biomarkers, diseases,\nviruses and bacteria. For example, Yonatan Adiri, founder of OwnHealth,\nuses the cloud to analyze photographs of urine test strips in order to diagnose\nmany medical conditions.\nMeanwhile, as mentioned in Chapter Three, the Qualcomm Tricorder X\nPrize will award $10 million to the first team that develops a handheld\nmedical device that not only diagnoses and monitors health conditions quickly\nand accurately, but is also capable of outperforming ten board-certified\ndoctors. Three hundred teams from around the world, including Scanadu—a\ncompany created for the sole purpose of winning the prize—are competing,\nand the prize is likely to be awarded within a year. (At least this aspect of\nStar Trek won’t take one hundred fifty years to be realized.)\nExOs are taking advantage of this accelerating trend in one of two ways:\nby creating new business models on existing data streams or by adding new\ndata streams to old paradigms. As an example of the former, consider\nPASSUR Aerospace. Since the early or late arrival of a flight can cost as\nmuch as $70 per minute, the company has set up refrigerator-sized ADS-B\n(automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) tracking stations across the U.S.\nThese stations monitor every plane in the sky and can accurately predict to the\nminute when an aircraft will arrive at its gate. In addition to offering\nenormous cost savings, the system is also being used in reverse by both the\nFAA and airlines to determine exactly when a given flight should take off.\nAs these and hundreds more examples suggest, we are moving toward a\nworld in which everything will be measured and anything can be knowable,both in the world around us and within our bodies. Only enterprises that plan\nfor this new reality will have a chance at long-term success.\nNow that we have finished describing the characteristics of ExOs and their\nimplications, we can look at the how an ExO maps onto other constructs.

In particular, the earliest playbook  for\nbuilding a hyper-growth company emerged during the dot-com boom  of 1998\nto 2000. That narrative gained a new chapter in 2005 with the rise of social\nmedia, and 2008 saw yet another chapter thanks to the widespread\navailability of low-cost cloud computing.\nToday, we are seeing the addition of the most important text yet with the\nrise of the Exponential Organization. Driven by accelerating technologies,\nExOs allow us to organize ourselves in new ways to tap into this information-\nenabled world.\nLocal Motors is a good example of an ExO startup. Founded by Jeff Jones\nand Jay Rogers in 2007, and based in Phoenix, Arizona, it is a global co-\ncreation platform that empowers its community to design, build and sell\ncustom-built vehicles. While serving as a Marine in Iraq in 2004,  Rogers read\nAmory Lovins’ book  Winning the Oil Endgam e and was inspired to create a\nnew type of car company. His goal (and MTP) was to bring exciting cars to\nmarket in an efficient way.\nRogers visited several car companies, including Ferrari, GM and Tesla,\nand set himself three goals:\n1.

This strategy failed, largely due to legal\nissues about ownership and licensing costs, although another problem was\nthat the students lacked a sense of purpose and commitment insofar as the\ncompany was concerned, which resulted in almost no contribution to the\nplatform [Experimentation]. Undaunted, Jones and Rogers took another shot at\nattracting community, this time via crowdsourcing. They were successful this\ntime around, and in March 2008,  Local Motors debuted as the first community\nto completely crowdsource a car. (The company currently has eighty-three\nemployees and three micro-factories for manufacturing.) The Local Motors\nstaff then turned its attention to evangelizing, sharing its passion for the\nproduct on numerous designer sites, which acted as magnets for a like-minded\ncommunity [Community & Crowd].\nNext, implementing Engagement, Local Motors undertook its first\ncompetition for a car design. At that time, the company had only four\nemployees, who were in charge of managing a thous and community members\n(talk about abundance). Ultimately, a hundred contest entries poured in,\nkicking off the platform’s formation. Today, the Local Motors community\nconsists of 43,100 members collaborating on 6,000 designs and 2,000 ideas\nacross thirty-one projects. Members average 200 t o 400 h ours per project.\nThe Local Motors community consists of enthusiasts, hobby ist innovators\nand professionals. They are designers, engineers and makers who participate\nin each component of the design (interior, exterior, name, logo, etc.), which is\nthen open sourced with a Creative Commons license. The platform can be\nthought of as a combination of Quirky (product development) and Kaggle\n(incentive competitions), but for cars and other vehicles.Once the initial community was established, Rogers moved on to his next\ngoal: to build the first crowdsourced automobile. In 2009, Local Motors\nachieved that goal with the production of the Rally Fighter, a car whose\nultimate design was a culmination of 35,000 designs contributed by 2,900\ncommunity members from more than 100 countries. Produced in just a year\nand a half, about five times faster than conventional processes, the Rally\nFighter cost just $3 million to develop. Buyers don’t receive an assembled\ncar; instead, $99,900 buys them a kit, complete with manuals, wikis and\nvideos. They also have access to Local Motors experts at one of three U.S.-\nbased micro-factories (one hundred more are slated to open worldwide in the\nnext ten years). There are currently twenty-three Rally Fighters in operation\naround the world, and its designer, Sangho Kim, landed a job at General\nMotors in South Korea as a result of his work on the car.\nLocal Motors also encourages other organizations to access its\ncommunity. In conjunction with the Shell Oil Company, Local Motors created\na competition in 2012 called the Shell GameChanger DRIVEN (Design of\nRelevant and Innovative Vehicles for Energy Needs). Contestants were tasked\nwith designing a vehicle that could be produced in the next five to ten years at\none of five locations (Amsterdam, Bangalore, Basra, Houston and Sao Paolo),\nusing locally sourced energy and materials. The design also required\ncontestants to address social challenges specific to each location. One winner\nin each location received $2,000, and the Grand Prize winner (of a total of\n214 entries) received an additional $5,000, as well as a quarter-scale model\nof his design that was to be shown around the world.\nTogether with BMW, Local Motors launched the Urban Driving\nExperience Challenge, in which contestants were required to address the\nlikely needs of an urban BMW driver in 2025. There were 414 entrants, and\nthe top ten received a total of $15,000 [Engagement]. Other challenges the\nLocal Motors community contributed to include designing the best delivery",

In fact, the best definition we’ve found for a\nstartup comes from Ries: “A startup is a human institution designed to\ndeliver a new produc t or service unde r conditions of extreme uncertainty.”\nA second book  we recommend is Peter Thiel and Blake Masters’ recent\npublication, Zero to One: Notes on St artups or How to Build the Future.\nThis is perhaps the best time in the history of business to build a new\nenterprise. The confluence of breakthrough technologies, acceptance (and\neven celebration) of entrepreneurship, different crowdsourcing options,\ncrowdfunding oppor tunities and legacy markets ripe for disruption—all create\na compelling (and unprecedented) scenario for new company creation.\nFurthermore, traditional risk areas have been mitigated like never before.\nContinuing our earlier comet/dinosaur analogy: the comet has struck, thedinosaurs are teetering and the conditions are ripe for a new category of\nsmall, nimble organisms to thrive. A new Cambrian Explosion, if you will.\nWhen assessing a startup for funding, investors typically categorize three\nmajor risk areas:\nTechnology r isk: Will it work?\nMarket risk: Will people buy the product?\nExecution risk: Is the team able to function and pivot as needed?\nThe challenge facing every startup lies in discovering how to de-risk each\nof these areas and, in the process, find a business model in the chosen\nproblem space. Nothing is more important.\nLet’s look at each of these three risk areas in turn:\nTechnology Risk\nIn 1995, it cost about $15 million to build a software startup based in\nSilicon Valley. That money mostly went to build server stacks, purchase\nsoftware and hire staff to configure and manage all that technology, as well as\nto write new code. By 2005, the cost had droppe d to about $4 million.\nServers were cheaper, and software, now often open sourced, was easier to\ndevelop and configure. Most hard costs were focused on marketing and sales.\nToday, with now-established capabilities such as cloud computing and\nsocial media, that same effort costs less than $100,000. The technology risk\nthat was once enormous (particularly software) has been reduced over the last\ntwenty years by 150x . Most of the remaining risk concerns mere scalability\nissues. A case in point: the rise of standardized web services allows complex\nsoftware functionality to be integrated into a startup at the press of a button.\nExamples include Google’s Prediction API for predictive analytics and\nAlchemyAPI for deep learning software for pattern recognition.To illustrate the sheer extent of this reduced technology risk, consider\nhardware startups. A new wave of large companies in Shenzhen, China (e.g.,\nFoxconn, Flextronics, PCH International), as well as open source hardware\nplatforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and 3D printers, allow anyone to\ndesign a hardware product and quickly prototype and build it. Liam Casey, the\nCEO of PCH, has aggressively turned his company into a platform on which\nanyone can launch a hardware startup, to the extent that individual wants to\ncreate the equivalent of an App Store for hardware startups. Brady Forrest,\nhead of Highway1, a PCH incubator, puts it simply: “We want hardware to be\nas easy as software.” Indeed, hardware is increasingly dissolving into\nsoftware.\nAccording to entrepreneur Chris Dixon, the most important change for\nentrepreneurs versus a decade ago is the ratio of reach to capital. Today, the\nreach of a startup is 100x  larger, while the capital needed is one tenth that of a\ndecade ago—a  thous andfold improvement in just ten years. The result is that\ntechnology risk, particularly for largely information-based or information-\nenabled businesses, has all but evaporated. (Needless to say, if you want to\nbuild a supertanker, you still need some capital.)\nMarket Risk\nAs to whether or not anyone will buy the product, we turn once again to\nSteve Blank, who famously said, “No business plan survives first contact with\na customer.” Historically, one had to first commission classic market\nresearch, fully build the product or service, hire an expensive sales force, and\nthen spend time and money marketing the idea—all before ever really\nknowing the answer to that question.\nThe Internet took one giant bite out of that paradigm and the emergence of\nsocial media took another. Starting in the 2000s , startups could test the marketlike never before by leveraging A/B testing, Google AdWords campaigns,\nsocial media and landing pages. Now an idea could be partially validated\nbefore product engineering even began.\nThe epitome of market validation, of course, is crowdfunding. Fundraising\nsites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow users to pre-purchase a product.\nIf enough people pre-purchase, the website releases money to the developer.\nWhile there’s a great deal of understandable excitement about the\ndemocratization of the fundraising process, we think the far more interesting\nconsequence is that, for the first time in history, entrepreneurs can validate\nmarket demand before building the product.\nExecution Risk\nSo, of the three major risk areas, execution risk remains the only real issue\nin building a company. How will the enterprise organize itself to maximize\nperformance from its founders and management team? How will it leverage\ntechnology and information to create a unique and sustainable advantage and\nbusiness model? Answering these questions correctly is the key to building a\nsuccessful Exponential Organization. For this reason, we need to look more\nclosely at each of the steps in building a pow erful and effective team.\nIn 2013, Aileen Lee published an extensive overview in TechCrunch of\nU.S.-based software startups with a market value of more than $1 billion over\nthe previous ten years, a group of companies she called Unicorns. As every\ncompany increasingly becomes a software company, her findings are ever\nmore relevant for classic vertical markets and sectors as well. While we\nrecommend reading the entire article, Lee’s key findings as they pertain to\nExOs are as follows:\nIt takes more than seven years, on average, before a “liquidity event.”",

        "contents": "Inexperienced twenty-something founders are outliers. Companies with\nwell-educated thirty-something co-founders who have history together\ntend to be most successful.\nThe idea of a “big pivot” to a different product after startup is an outlier.\nMost Unicorns stick to their original vision (i.e., their founding MTP).\nWe have found that there is a strong correlation between ExOs and Lee’s\nUnicorns. In fact, in our diagnostic, most of Lee’s Unicorns score well above\nthe ExO threshold score. Their relatively young age means these Unicorn\ncompanies have been leveraging new information streams, have a low cost of\nsupply and embrace community—and can thus scale. Most have gotten to their\ncurrent heights by following some combination of the steps below.\nStep 1: Select an MTP (Massive Transformative\nPurpose).\nThis is the most elemental and foundational aspect of a startup. Feeding on\nSimon Sinek’s “Why?” question, it is critical that you are excited and utterly\npassionate about the problem space you plan to attack. So, begin by asking the\nquestion: What is the biggest problem I’d like to see solved? Identify that\nproblem space and then come up with an MTP for it. Even as a child, Elon\nMusk, perhaps the world’s most celebrated entrepreneur today, had a burning\ndesire to address energy, transportation and space travel at a global level. His\nthree companies (SolarCity, Tesla and SpaceX) are each addressing those\nspaces. Each has a Massive Transformative Purpose.\nKeep in mind, however, that an MTP is not a business decision. Finding\nyour passion is a personal journey. As Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber, said at\nthe 2013 LeWeb conference in Paris, “You have to be self-aware and look forthat startup idea and purpose that is a perfect fit with you—with you as a\nperson, not as a business[person].” Howard Thurman, the American author\nand philosopher, summarizes the same idea as follows: “Don’t just ask what\nthe world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do it. What the\nworld needs is people who have come alive.”\nDrew Houston, founder of Dropbox , agrees: “The most successful people\nare obsessed with solving an important problem, something that matters to\nthem. They remind me of a dog chasing a tennis ball. To increase your own\nchances of happiness and success, you must find your tennis ball—the thing\nthat pulls you.”\nFinding an MTP can be seen as a novel and perhaps more interesting way\nof asking yourself the following questions:\nWhat do I really care about?\nWhat am I meant to do?\nTwo more questions that can help speed the process of discovering your\npassion:\nWhat would I do if I could never fail?\nWhat would I do if I received a billion dollars today?\nIt is not only about you as an entrepreneur, however. It is also about your\nemployees. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel poses the following question as an\neffective way to test if a startup has an MTP that will attract not only friends,\nbut also employees beyond your personal network who share your motivation:\n“Why would the 20th employee join your startup without the perks, [such as] a\nco-founder title or stock [options]?”\nAccordingly, you should gauge your MTP against each of the acronym’s\nletters. Is it Massive? Is it Transformative? Is it Purposeful? A profit motive",

        "contents": "alone is insufficient to build an ExO—or, frankly, any startup. Rather, it’s the\nburning passion to solve an obsessive, complex problem that keeps an\nentrepreneur pushing along the rollercoaster ride of ebullience and despair\nthat is the story of every startup. Chip Conley, an expert at building purpose-\ndriven companies such as Airbnb, frequently references Kahlil Gibran: “Work\nis love made visible. The goal is not to live forever; the goal is to create\nsomething that will.”\nStep 2: Join or Create Relevant MTP Communities\nThe collaborative power of communities is critical to any ExO. Whatever\nyour passion (let’s say you dream of curing cancer), there are communities out\nthere filled with other passionate, purpose-driven people devoted to the same\ncrusade.\nThe recent rise of the Quantified Self (QS) movement, first introduced in\nChapter Five, is a great example of a community with an MTP. Operating in\n120 cities and in forty countries, approximately 1,000 companies and 40,000\nmembers currently participate in the QS ecosystem. Anyone interested in\nsetting up a medical device company or addressing a major area such as\ncancer or heart disease can find and join a rich community of interested\nfellow participants. For example, some of the many communities devoted to\ncancer or heart disease research include TED MED, Health Foo, DIYbio,\nGET (Genes/Environment/Traits), WIRED Health, Sensored, Stream Health\nand Exponential Medicine.\nIf you think your problem space doesn’t have community support, take a\nlook at www.meetup.com. Meetup’s mission is both to revitalize local\ncommunities and to help people around the world organize. The companybelieves that people can change the world by organizing themselves into\ngroups that are powerful enough to make a difference. Founded by Scott\nHeiferman in January 2002, Meetup helps convene more than 150,000\ninterest-based groups—made up of about ten million members—in 197\ncountries around the world. Given those numbers, the odds  are pretty good\nthat a passionate and purpose-driven community concerned with your problem\nspace already exists in your own country.\nHowever, in any community-driven startup, there’s a tension between the\ngood of the community and the good of the company. For Chris Anderson the\nchoice is an easy one:\nThere is a fundamental DNA path dependency here. Are you\nprimarily a community or are you primarily a company? The\nreason you have to ask yourself this is because sooner or later the\ntwo will come in conflict. We [DIY Drones] are primarily a\ncommunity. Every day, we make decisions that disadvantage the\ncompany to bring advantage to the community.\nAnderson said the advice to opt for the good of the community came from\nMatt Mullenweg, the CEO of WordPress, the world’s most widely used\nblogging platform. According to Mullenweg, “Whenever this moment comes\nup, always bet on the community, because that’s the difference between long-\nterm thinking and short-term thinking.”\nBasically, if you get the community right, oppor tunities will arise. If you\nget community wrong, the engine of innovation dissolves and you won’t have\na company anymore.",

        "contents": "Step 3: Compose a Team\nWhile the founding team in any startup is important, given the rapid\nscaling of an ExO company with a very small footprint in terms of resources,\nthe careful composition of its founding team is especially critical.\nIn his book  The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps\nEverything Else In Business, Patrick Lencioni argues that the single best way\nto determine the health of an organization is by “observing the leadership team\nduring a meeting.” Leadership interaction proves to be an accurate barometer\nof team dynamics, clarity, decisiveness and cognitive biases. Furthermore, the\nkey to putting together a successful ExO founding team is that everyone shares\na passion for the MTP. Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen-Horowitz,\none of the world’s most successful VCs, noted the importance of shared\npassion in his recent book , The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a\nBusiness When There Are No Easy Answers: “If founders are in a startup for\nthe wrong reasons (money, ego), it often degenerates into a nasty situation.”\nSimilarly, it’s worth revisiting one of the main points of Aileen Lee’s\nUnicorn study: companies composed of well-educated thirty-something co-\nfounders with a shared work or school history have the highest success rate.\nHer research shows that the average age of a Unicorn founder is thirty-four,\nand the average number of co-founders is three. In addition, most successful\nfounder CEOs have technical backgrounds.\nOne caveat is that for a community-driven company, diversity is an\nimportant part of the package. While building out his DIY Drones community,\nfor example, Chris Anderson came across Jordi Munoz of Mexico, who was\njust nineteen years old at the time. Anderson found that along with a mutual\npassion for drones, Munoz’s skills were both fundamentally different from and\ncomplementary to his own. Impressed by the young man’s capabilities,\nenthusiasm and ability to learn, Anderson brought him on as a co-founder.Today, though young and without the “right” background, Munoz is thriving in\nhis role as CEO of a multi-million dollar company.\nThe following roles are critical if founding ExO teams are to deliver\ndiverse backgrounds, independent thought and complementary skills:\nVisionary/Dreamer: The primary role in the company’s story. The\nfounder with the strongest vision for the company comes up with the\nMTP and holds the organization to it.\nUser Experience Design: Role focuses on users’ needs and ensures that\nevery contact with users is as intuitive, simple and clear as possible.\nProgramming/Engineering: Role responsible for bringing together the\nvarious technologies required to build the product or service.\nFinance/Business: The business function assesses the viability and\nprofitability of the organization, is the cornerstone of interactions with\ninvestors and manages the all-important burn rate.\nIn The Innov ator’s DNA: Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive\nInnov ators, co-author Clayton Christensen approaches the skill portfolio\nquestion slightly differently, identifying two distinct sets of skills:\nDiscovery skills: The ability to generate ideas—to associate, question,\nobserve, network and experiment.\nDelivery skills: The ability to execute ideas—to analyze, plan,\nimplement, follow through and be detail-oriented.\nThese are just two of many ways of looking at how to put a founding team\ntogether. Whatever the approach, however, founders must be intrinsically\nmotivated self-starters. Most of all, in the face of rapid growth and change,\nthey must have complete trust in one another’s judgment.\nThink about the PayPal story. Peter Thiel told his co-founders (Elon Musk,\nReid Hoffman, Luke Nosek, Max Levchin and Chad Hurley) and employees",

        "contents": "that they all should work together as friends rather than more formally as\nemployees. Looking back, perhaps friendship was PayPal’s MTP. Not only\nwas PayPal very successful as a company—it was sold to eBay for $1.2\nbillion—bu t the friendships that grew out of it were equally successful. The\noriginal team is now known as the “PayPal Mafia,” and its members have\nhelped one another on subsequent startups, including Tesla, YouTube,\nSpaceX, LinkedIn, Yelp, Yammer and Palantir—companies that today have a\ntotal market cap of more than $60 bi llion.\nThe pace of growth of an ExO requires an extra emphasis on a fully\nsynergistic core team. As Arianna Huffington says, “I would rather have\nsomebody  much less brilliant and who’s a team player, who’s straightforward,\nthan somebody  who is very brilliant and toxic to the organization.”\nStep 4: Breakthrough Idea\nWe don’t have to tell you that this next step is a big one. It is essential to\nleverage technology or information in some way to transform the status quo.\nAnd when we say transform, we really do mean it. ExOs are not about\nincremental improvement in a marketplace. They are about radical change.\nAccording to Marc Andreessen, “Most entrepreneurs prefer failing\nconventionally rather than succeeding unconventionally.”\nRemember, the three key success factors for an ExO idea are:\nFirst, a minimum 10x improvement over the status quo.\nSecond, leveraging information to radically cut the cost of marginal\nsupply (i.e., the cost to expand the supply side of the business should be\nminimal).Third, the idea should pass the “toothbrush test” originated by Larry\nPage: Does the idea solve a real customer problem or use case on a\nfrequent basis? Is it something so useful that a user would go back to it\nseveral times a day?\nIt is also possible to leverage a community or crowd to discover\nbreakthrough ideas or new patterns of implementation. Elon Musk set an MTP\nfor transforming transportation with his Hyperloop high-speed transportation\nidea. At the same time, he opened up the design and implementation of that\nidea to whoever wanted to take a crack at it.\nIt may seem counterintuitive to delay the breakthrough idea several steps\ninto the process. After all, legend holds that most startups begin with an\nexplosive new idea that’s then applied to a problem space. We believe,\nhowever, that it’s better to start with a passion to solve a particular problem,\nrather than to start with an idea or a technology.\nThere are two reasons for this. First, by focusing on the problem space,\nyou are not tied to one particular idea or solution, and thus don’t end up\nshoehorning a technology into a problem space where it might not be a good\nfit. Silicon Valley is littered with the carcasses of companies with great\ntechnologies searching for a problem to solve. Second, there is no shortage of\neither ideas or new technologies. After all, everybody  in a place like Silicon\nValley has an idea for a new tech business. Instead, the key to success is\nrelentless execution, hence the need for passion and the MTP. To demonstrate,\nconsider the number of times the founders of the following companies pitched\ninvestors before finally succeeding:\nCompanyNumber of Investor Pitches\nSkype 40\nCisco 76Pandora300\nGoogle 350\nWhat if Larry Page and Sergey Brin had stoppe d pitching after 340\nattempts? The world would be a very different place today. Just as intriguing:\nwhat magical technologies and businesses don’t exist today because the\nfounders gave up one investor pitch too soon?\nWe’ve said this already, but it can’t be emphasized enough:\nEntrepreneurial success rarely comes from the idea. Instead, it comes from the\nfounding team’s never-say-die attitude and relentless execution. Those who\nreally want something will find options. Those who just kind of want it will\nfind reasons and excuses. This has been the case since Hewlett and Packard\nstarted their business in that now-famous Palo Alto dirt-floor garage—where,\ndon’t forget, they began with a passion and not a product. In the end, only raw,\nunbridled passion can solve an important problem and overcome the endless\nhurdles that present themselves. As investor Fred Wilson says, “Startups\nshould be hunch-driven early on, and data-driven as they scale.”\nPayPal co-founder Peter Thiel builds on this with a profound question for\nstartup founders: “Tell me something you believe is true but [that] you have a\nhard time trying to convince others [of].” This is about conviction and passion\non the one hand, and radical, unconventional, breakthrough ideas on the other.\nAs Peter Diamandis is fond of saying, “The day before a major breakthrough,\nit is just a crazy idea.”\nTo illustrate: In a recent conversation with Elon Musk, Salim asked Musk\nabout his Hyperloop concept: “Elon, I have a background in physics and it\nseems impossible to accelerate humans to 1,000 kilometers an hour and then\ndecelerate them to zero in such a short space of time. Have you thought about\nthat?”\nMusk’s answer? “Yes, it’s an issue.”To a true entrepreneur, there are no impossibilities, just barriers to\novercome. (And yes, it turned out there is a solution to that particular physics\nproblem—qu ite an easy one, in fact—via fluid dynamics).\nAs mentioned earlier, Chris Anderson’s DIY Drones product ArduCopter\nreplicates 98 percent of the functionality of a military-grade Predator drone at\none-thousandth the cost. That’s a drone for less than $1,000. It’s also\ntransformational. Note the sudden appearance of drones in the planning\nagendas of companies as diverse as Amazon, QuiQui and UPS. This is not a\ncoincidence.\nSuch breakthrough thinking also inspires. At Singularity University,\nstudents form teams in major problem spaces such as healthcare, education,\nclean water and so on. They are then given the challenge of coming up with a\nproduct or service that could positively impact a billion people within a\ndecade [MTP]. One team, which called itself Matternet, chose pove rty as its\nproblem space after reading that 85 percent of all roads in Africa are\nregularly washed out during the wet season.\nBut how do you alleviate pove rty if you can’t easily transport people or\nitems? That question led Matternet to home in on “Transportation in\nDeveloping Countries” as its MTP. When Anderson described his DIY\nDrones idea in a lecture, the team had an epiphany: In the same way that\nAfrica leapfrogged the entire coppe r wire telephony generation by going\nstraight to wireless, why not use drones to do the same thing with\ntransportation, and avoid building roads altogether?\nThe most exciting trend in drones today is that they’re doubling their\nprice/performance ratio every nine months. That’s twice as fast as Moore’s\nLaw. A drone today can carry a four kilogram package up to a distance of\ntwenty kilometers. In nine months, that drone’s capacity will double to eight\nkilograms per twenty kilometers, and nine months after that things will get\nreally interesting at sixteen kilograms over twenty kilometers.

For more on how to create effective value\npropos itions, we recommend reading Osterwalder’s new book , Value\nPropos ition D esign: How to Create Produc ts and Se rvices Customers Want.\nStep 6: Find a Business Model\nIt is also important to understand that if you’re going to achieve a 10x\nimprovement, there’s a strong likelihood that your company will require a\ncompletely new business model. As Clayton Christensen illustrated in The\nInnov ators Dilemma, which was published in 1997, disruption is mostly\nachieved by a startup offering a less expensive product using emerging\ntechnologies and meeting a future or unmet customer need or niche.\nChristensen emphasized that it is not so much about disruptive products, but\nmore about new business models threatening incumbents.For example, Southwest Airlines treated its planes like buses and created\nan entire niche for itself. Google created the AdWords business model, which\nnever existed before the advent of web pages. In the near future, micro-\ntransactions, enabled by crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, will create entirely\nnew financial business models that have never existed before.\nIn his 2005 book , Free: The Future of a Radical Price, Chris Anderson\nbuilt on the lower cost positioning of the disruptor, noting that pretty much all\nbusiness models, and certainly those that are information-based, will soon be\noffered to consumers for free. The popu lar “freemium” model is just such a\ncase: many websites offer a basic level of service at no cost, while also\nenabling users to pay a fee to upgrade to more storage, statistics or extra\nfeatures. Advertising, cross-subsidies and subscription business models are\nother ways of layering profit-generating operations on top of what is\nessentially free baseline information.\nKevin Kelly expanded further on this idea in a seminal post entitled\n“Better than Free,” which appeared on his Technium blog in 2008. In digital\nnetworks anything can be copied and is thus “abundant.” So how do you add\nor extract value? What is valuable for customers? What is the new scarcity?\nWhat are the new value drivers? Kelly identified the following eight ways to\nbuild a business model when the underlying information is free:\n1. Immediacy: Immediacy is the reason people order in advance on\nAmazon or attend the theater on opening night. Being the first to know\nabout or experience something has intrinsic cultural, social and even\ncommercial value. In short: time confers privilege.\n2. Personalization: Having a product or service customized just for you\nnot only gives added value in terms of quality of experience and ease-of-\nuse or functionality, it also creates “stickiness,” as both parties are\ninvested in the process.3. Interpretation: Even if the product or service is free, there is still\nconsiderable added value to any service that can help shorten the\nlearning curve to using it—or using it better. Kelly often jokes:\n“Software: free; the manual: $10,000.”\n4. Authenticity: Added value comes from a guarantee that the product or\nservice is real and safe—that it is, in Kelly’s words, “bug-free, reliable\nand warranted.”\n5. Accessibility: Ownership requires management and maintenance. In an\nera where we own hundreds of apps on several platforms, any service\nthat helps us organize everything and improve our ability to find what we\nneed quickly is of particular value.\n6. Embodiment: Digital information has no “body ,” no physical form, until\nwe give it one—high definition, 3D, a movie screen, a smartphone. We\nwillingly pay more to have free software delivered to us in the physical\nformat we prefer.\n7. Patronage: “It is my belief that audiences WANT to pay creators,”\nKelly wrote. “Fans like to reward artists, musicians, authors and the like\nwith tokens of their appreciation, because it allows them to connect. But\nthey will only pay if it is very easy to do, the amount is reasonable, and\nthey feel certain the money will directly benefit the creators.” He adds\nthat another benefit of a simple payment process is that it capitalizes on\nusers’ impulsiveness. Examples include iTunes songs and Spotify, as\nwell as Netflix subscriptions. Customers choose to pay for each of these\nservices even though the same content can be acquired through piracy.\n8. Findability: A creative work has no value unless its potential audience\ncan find it. Such “findability” only exists at the aggregator level, as\nindividual creators typically get lost in the noise. Thus, attaching\nyourself to effective channels and digital platforms like app stores,\nsocial media sites or online marketplaces where potential users can find\nyou has considerable value to creators (and, ultimately, to users).We believe the above  list offers a set of working business models for an\ninformation age. The chart below shows how budding ExOs are leveraging\none or more of these models:Let’s return to the Business Model Canvas—and in particular to\npartnering, which is one of its features.\nFred Wilson, of Union Square Ventures, has pointed out that many\nincumbents in different industries are currently being disrupted—a nd not by\njust one startup, but by many different startups, all attacking one individual\nservice within an industry. He sees major disruption in business models as\neither unbundling or rebundling.\nFor example, let’s look at the financial services industry. A classic bank\noffers many services such as payment infrastructure, trust, mobile and social\nwallets, e-commerce and m-commerce solutions, lending, investments, stocks,\netc. It is a consolidated or aggregated offering of different individual financial\nservices. Those banks are now being disrupted by a variety of financial\nstartups, including Square, Clinkle, Stripe, Lending Club, Kickstarter, eToro\nand Estimize. We consider this fragmentation of individual financial services\na form of unbundl ing.\nNow, what if all these startups decided to coope rate or merge within the\nnext five years? What if they agreed to create alliances via open APIs? What\nif they partnered and rebundl ed? You’d end up with a completely new bank\nwith at least 10x less overhead than that of its predecessors, as the new entity\nwould require less real estate and fewer employees.\nIn sum, Step 6 is about creating new business models, which increasingly\ntend towards free and freemium models. These new business models have,\npotentially, eight new value drivers to generate revenues, differentiate them\nfrom competitors, and allow for a long-term strategy to align with adjacent\nExOs in a particular industry to fully disrupt incumbents, rather than just one\nindividual good or service offered.

The MVP is a kind of applied experiment to\ndetermine the simplest product that will allow the team to go to market and\nsee how users respond (as well as help find investors for the next round of\ndevelopment). Feedback loops  can then rapidly iterate the product to optimize\nit and drive the feature roadmap of its development. Learning, testing\nassumptions, pivoting and iterating are key in this step.\nNote the transformation: while Step 1 is about the MTP, or Purpose, Step\n7 is about Experimentation. However, this is not the whole story when it\ncomes to most successful startups. As Peter Thiel explains: “Not all startups\nthrive by experimentation and purpose only.” LinkedIn, Palantir and SpaceX\nwere fundamentally successful due to a strong vision of the future. Similarly,\nThiel’s observation is further substantiated by Aileen Lee’s Unicorns research\n(which we addressed earlier in the chapter).\nThe early websites of LinkedIn, Facebook , Twitter and Foursquare are all\nexamples of MVPs in action. Their early sites were clunky and inelegant with\ndifficult navigation paths. However, they were able to quickly ratify core\nassumptions, understood key user requirements and implemented rapid\nfeedback loops  to fix problems.\nStep 8: Validate Marketing and Sales\nOnce the product is being used in its chosen market(s), a customer\nacquisition funnel will need to be established to help drive new visitors to the\nproduct. Its role is to qualify potential customers and convert them into users\nand paying customers. A good starting point for this is Dave McClure’s",

(Value metric)\nReferral: Do users tell others? (Growth metric)\nThe AARRR model is not easy to forget once you use it (and neither is\nMcClure sporting an eye patch and waving a fake sword).\nStep 9: Implement SCALE and IDEAS\nAs already noted, becoming an ExO does not mean implementing all 11\nSCALE and IDEAS attributes. A great MTP and three or four other attributes\nare usually sufficient for success. The key, of course, is determining which\nattributes are the right ones to execute. The following is a guide to\nimplementing ExO attributes into a startup:\nMTP: Formulate an MTP in a particular problem space, one\nthat all founders feel passionate about.\nStaff on Demand: Use contractors, SoD platforms wherever\npossible; keep FTEs to a minimum.\nCommunity & Crowd: Validate idea in MTP communities.\nGet product feedback.\nFind co-founders, contractors and experts.Use crowdfunding and crowdsourcing to validate market\ndemand and as a marketing technique.\nAlgorithms: Identify data streams that can be automated and\nhelp with product development. Implement cloud-based\nand open source machine and deep learning to increase\ninsights.\nLeveraged Assets: Do NOT acquire assets.\nUse cloud computing, TechShop for product development.\nUse incubators like Y Combinator and Techstars for\noffice, funding, mentoring and peer input.\nStarbucks as office.\nEngage ment: Design product with engagement in mind.\nGather all user interactions.\nGamify where possible.\nCreate a digital reputational system of users and suppliers\nto build trust and community.\nUse incentive prizes to engage crowd and create buzz.\nInterfaces: Design custom processes for managing SCALE;\ndo not automate until you’re ready to scale.\nDashboar ds: Set up OKR and value, serendipity, and growth\nmetrics dashboards; do not implement value metrics until\nproduct finalized (see Step 10) .\nExperimentation: Establish culture of experimentation and\nconstant iteration. Be willing to fail and pivot as needed.\nAutonomy: Implement lite version of Holacracy. Start with\nthe General Company Circle as a first step; then move\nonto governance meetings.Implement the GitHub technical and organizational model\nwith radical openness, transparency and permission.\nSocial Technologies: Implement file sharing, cloud-based\ndocument management.\nCollaboration and activity streams both internally and\nwithin your community.\nMake a plan to test and implement telepresence, virtual\nworlds and emotional sensing.\nThe table below shows our assessment of leading ExOs and the attributes\nthey’ve most leveraged, showing a good distribution and usage of both\nSCALE and IDEAS elements.\n",

        "contents": "Step 10: Establish the Culture\nPerhaps the most critical step in building an ExO involves establishing its\nculture. Think again about PayPal’s culture of close friendship rather than\nformal work relationships. In a fast-scaling organization, culture—along with\nthe MTP and Social Technologies—is the glue that keeps a team together\nthrough the quantum leaps of an ExO’s growth. Needless to say, given that\neven defining the term culture has proven enduringly difficult, this is a\nparticularly challenging step.\nAccording to noted hotelier Chip Conley, “Culture is what happens when\nthe boss leaves.” We think that pretty much sums it up, and would only add\nthat culture is a company’s greatest intangible asset. (As many have observed,\nincluding Joi Ito, head of the MIT Media Lab, “Culture eats strategy for\nbreakfast.”) From the “HP Way” and IBM’s “Think” to Google’s playrooms\nand Twitter’s warehouse, it is hard to overstate culture’s added value. Very\nfew people would argue that a big part of Zappos ’ success (and its billion-\ndollar valuation) is not due to its company culture.\nEstablishing a corporate culture starts with learning how to effectively\ntrack, manage and reward performance. And that begins with designing the\nOKR system we outlined in Chapter Four, and then continues through the\nprocess of getting the team habituated to transparency, accountability,\nexecution and high performance.\nStep 11: Ask Key Questions Periodically\nThere are eight key questions to think about—not once, but repeatedly—as\nyou build out your startup. Successfully answering each one gives you a\npassing grade in terms of this chapter:1. Who is your customer?\n2. Which customer problem are you solving?\n3. What is your solution and doe s it improve the status quo by at least 10x?\n4. How will you market the product or service?\n5. How are you selling the product or service?\n6. How do you turn customers into advoc ates using viral effects and Net\nPromoter Scores to drive dow n the marginal cost of demand?\n7. How will you scale your customer segment?\n8. How will you drive the marginal cost of supply towards zero?\nAs mentioned earlier, that final question is the most critical for an ExO.\nTo be truly disruptive to the status quo and achieve the 10x scalability that is\nthe hallmark of ExOs, some combination of IDEAS and SCALE must drive\ndown the cost of supply exponentially.\nA final word on timing: For any startup to be successful, it must combine\nrequisite skills, hard work and great market timing (especially when it comes\nto technology).\nAs Ray Kurzweil says: “An invention needs to make sense in the world\nin which it is finished, not the world in which it is started.” This is a\nprofound point, one often missed by founders. It is about understanding the\nevolutionary trajectory of technology. That is, which functionalities and\ncapacities will become feasible in two or three years given the pace of\nMoore’s Law? When you develop a product with the near future in mind\ninstead of the present, it greatly increases your chances of success.\nFuturist Paul Saffo has said that most transformative (technological)\ninventions fail the first few times when launched, and generally take fifteen\nyears to be fully realized. Why? Various reasons: too early, bad timing,\nunproven business models, integration issues—all result in a poor customer\nexperience in an even poor er marketplace.

        "contents": "startups.” There is a certain threshold value, which is why we’ve set a\nminimum 10x requirement for starting Exponential Organizations.\nStep 12: Building and Maintaining a Platform\nLeading platform expert Sangeet Paul Choudary identified the four steps\nneeded to build a successful platform (as oppos ed to a successful product):\n1. Identify a pain poi nt or use case for a consumer.\n2. Identify a core value unit or social object in any interaction between a\nproducer and consumer. This could be anything. Pictures, jokes, advice,\nreviews, information about sharing rooms, tools and car-rides are\nexamples of things that have led to successful platforms. Remember that\nmany people will be both producers and consumers, and use this to your\nadvantage.\n3. Design a way to facilitate that interaction. Then see if you can build it as\na small prototype that you can curate yourself. If it works at that level, it\nwill be worth taking to the next level and scaling.\n4. Determine how to build a network around your interaction. Find a way to\nturn your platform user into an ambassador. Before you know it, you’ll\nbe on a roll.\nTo implement platforms, ExOs follow four steps in terms of data and\nAPIs:\n1. Gather: The algorithmic process starts with harnessing data, which is\ngathered via sensors, people, or imported from public datasets.\n2. Organize: The next step is to organize the data. This is known as ETL\n(extract, transform and load).",

These\nare realized via tools such as Hadoop and Pivotal, or even (open source)\ndeep learning algorithms like DeepMind or Skymind.\n4. Expose: The final step is exposing the data in the form of an open\nplatform. Open data and APIs can be used such that an ExO’s community\ndevelops valuable services, new functionalities and innovations layered\non top of the platform by remixing published data with their own.\nExamples of companies that have successfully exposed their data this\nway are the Ford Company, Uber, IBM Watson, Twitter and Facebook .\nWe can’t emphasize the following strongly enough: the world that is\nemerging is very different from the one we’ve known. Power is becoming\neasier to acquire but harder to keep. Thanks to strong viral and social network\neffects that allow startups to scale rapidly, it is now easier than ever before to\nstart new companies and disrupt industries. But when it comes to social\nnetworks, the reverse is also true. Facebook , for example, is an incumbent,\nand its network effects and lock-in make it hard to usurp—u nderscoring the\ngreat advantage a platform has over a product or service.\nIn her book , The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your\nStrategy Moving as Fast as Your Business, Rita Gunther McGrath illustrates\nthat we can only obtain what she calls Transient Competitive Advantages via\nplatforms and purpose, community, and culture.\nIn Concert\nWhen it all comes together—when a great MTP is devised and the right\nattributes are implemented—the results can be stunning. France’s BlaBlaCaris a case in point.\nFounded in 2004 by Frédéric Mazzella, Nicolas Brusson and Francis\nNappez, BlaBlaCar (formerly known as covoiturage.fr) is a peer-to-peer\nmarketplace that connects drivers with empty seats with passengers looking\nfor rides. The service is active in twelve countries and has over eight million\nmembers. One million people currently use the service each month (a total\nthat is expected to climb), more than the number of passengers who ride\nEurostar, Europe’s leading train company, which carries 833,000 customers a\nmonth. BlaBlaCar uses the same business model as Airbnb—dr ivers are paid\nfor every ride—with BlaBlaCar taking 10 pe rcent. While Uber currently faces\nmany legal issues like commercial and liability insurance, BlaBlaCar won’t\nface those same problems, since the model it follows is comparable to asking\nfriends to pay for fuel when they hitch a ride. Essentially, BlaBlaCar offers\ncarpooling over longer distances—city to city, for example, rather than within\nindividual cities—making it a great deal, since it is much cheaper to share a\nride than to take a train or plane. An average 200-mile ride, for example,\ncosts only $25. To enable its platform, BlaBlaCar—which was named runner-\nup for Best International Startup at the 2013 Crunchies Awards, and was\nbested only by Waze—utilizes algorithms to match drivers and riders\n[Algorithms]. (Clearly 2013 w as a bad traffic year.)\nBlaBlaCar has achieved success by creating an entirely new transport\nnetwork (its MTP is People-Powered Transport) comprised of a trusted\ncommunity of drivers and passengers. The result is a more social and efficient\nform of transport, allowing drivers to save an estimated $345 million each\nyear. The business also prevents the release of 700,000 tons of carbon\ndioxide into the atmosphere each year, offering a clear social and ecological\nbenefit.\nLike Tony Hsieh of Zappos , Mazzella wants BlaBlaCar to be considered\namong the best companies to work for. To keep morale high, he initiated theBlaBlaSwap program, which offers all employees (the company currently has\na staff of 115) the oppor tunity to work in any of the company’s international\noffices for one week a year. In addition, the company gathers all employees\ntogether for weekly “BlaBlaTalk” sessions—international employees join via\nvideoconferencing—which provide staff the oppor tunity to share their\nachievements from the previous six weeks and their plans for the next six\n[Social Technologies].\nThe company also takes a Lean approach in terms of software\ndevelopment, enabling multiple small teams to develop its software through\niteration. It is also important to note that BlaBlaCar stalled (pun intended)\nseveral times on its journey over the past ten years, transforming from B2B to\nC2C and pivoting through three different business models [Experimentation\nand Autonomy].\nTo engage the community, BlaBlaCar relies on its own digital reputation\nsystem, a framework it refers to as D.R.E.A.M.S. (Declared, Rated, Engaged,\nActivity-Based, Moderated and Social) [Engagement], which is outlined\nbelow:\nDeclared: Trusted online profile, providing more information about\nusers.\nRatings: Collaborative services ask users to rate one another after\nhaving met “In Real Life,” enabling people to build good online\nreputations.\nEngage ment: If members are to feel completely comfortable transacting\nwith one another, they must believe other parties will honor financial\ncommitments.\nActivity-based: Offer contextually relevant and real-time information to\nboth buyer and supplier, ensuring that the transaction progresses\nsmoothly, from initial interest through to payment.",

Clearly, the company is doing\neverything right; in July 2014, it raised a staggering $100 million in equity\nfunding.\nLessons for Enterprise ExOs (EExOs)\nMuch of what we have covered in this chapter applies to pure startups, as\nwell as to startups growing out of existing enterprises. However, there are\nsome special considerations for Enterprise ExOs (EExOs). According to\nSalim, the greatest danger when building an Enterprise ExO is that the\n“immune system” of the parent company will come and attack it.\nOnly go after new markets (to avoid the immune system response). If you\nwant to transform an existing cash cow or leapfrog a current business\nunit, you need a stand-alone unit with a small team that is isolated and\nfully autonomous.\nEstablish direct support from—and a direct formal link to—the CEO.\nWhatever you do, do not settle for any other reporting line below the\nCEO, and that goes triple for the CFO.\nSpin out versus spin in. If you are successful, spin everything out and\ncreate a new company; don’t try to wedge the emerging business back\ninto the mother ship. A new enterprise won’t fit neatly anywhere and\ninternal politics will ensue, especially if you are cannibalizing anexisting revenue stream. The only exception we’ve found is when\nindividual EExOs are part of a larger platform play like Apple’s\nproducts, which start out at the edge and are brought into the center.\nInvite the most disruptive change-makers from within your existing\norganization to work on your EExO. Management expert Gary Hamel has\nsaid that young people, dissidents and those working on the geographic\nand mental peripheries of your organization are the most interesting, free\nand open thinkers. Look for rebels. The good news is that they won’t be\ndifficult to find.\nBuild your ExO completely independent of existing systems and policies.\nThat includes actual physical separation. Try hard not to use existing\npremises or infrastructure unless they deliver a huge strategic advantage.\nAs with any new startup, it’s critical for a new ExO to operate as a\ngreenfield ope ration, relying on stealth and confidentiality.\nAs Steve Jobs said, “We run Apple like a startup. We always let ideas\nwin arguments, not hierarchies. Otherwise, your best employees won’t stay.\nCollaboration, discipline and trust are critical.”\nFor those interested in a more thorough treatment of starting an ExO, Peter\nDiamandis and Steven Kotler’s second book , BOLD (Simon & Schuster, Feb\n2015) , is written for the entrepreneur interested in going from an idea to\nrunning a billion-dollar company in record time.CHAPTER SEVEN\nExOs and M id-Market Companies\nIn the last chapter, we discussed how to start an Exponential Organization. But\nthe ExO model is not exclusive to entrepreneurship and startup companies. In\nfact, it is possible to take an established mid-market company and\nsupercharge it to exponential growth.\nIn this chapter, we’ll look at mid-market enterprises and show how they\ncan take advantage of the ExO philosophy. Unlike startups (where you can\nbuild all of the internal operations from scratch around exponential growth),\nwith established companies, the solution is inevitably customized: you must\nstart with what already exists and build from there. In other words, there is no\nuniversal template for “going exponential.”\nFor that reason, we will look at case studies of five very different\ncompanies that became Exponential Organizations, illustrating how to take an\nestablished organization whose growth has plateaued in a stable business\nenvironment…and then transform it into an ExO and achieve the desired 10x\nperformance improvements promised by the model.\nExample 1: TED\nIn 1984, Richard Saul Wurman created the TED (Technology,\nEntertainment, Design) Conference.

By curating the talks with extreme careand pioneering the now-famous eighteen-minute format, TED thrived,\nbecoming an annual pilgrimage for many of the world’s movers and shakers.\nEighteen years after its creation, TED had reached middle age. It was\nprofitable and respected, hosting about a thousand people every year in\nMonterey, California, but had leveled off in terms of annual growth (albeit\ndeliberately). In short, TED had achieved a comfortable stasis.\nThen, in 2001, Chris Anderson, who built Business 2.0 and IGN via his\nentity the Imagine Media Group, acquired TED. Anderson had a vision for\ntaking TED to the next level by expanding its scale of operations to a global\noperation and its base of participants from power brokers to the educated\nmasses.\nTo do so, he made two game-changing alterations. First, he offered both\nnew and past TED talks for free over the Internet. Second, as noted in Chapter\nFive, working with Lara Stein, he created a toolkit for any TED member to\ncreate a TEDx franchise event in his or her own locale. The results were\nastounding: Today, more than thirty-six thousand TED and TEDx talks are\navailable on the web and have been viewed almost two billion times. Along\nthe way, TED has gone from an annual gathering of dilettantes to one of the\nworld’s most popu lar and influential forums for the exchange of ideas.\nNow, let’s look at this program from an ExO perspective. From the beginning,\nas first elucidated by Wurman, TED had both an appealing and scalable MTP:\n“Ideas Worth Spreading.” When Anderson turned the TED talks into free\nonline content, he created Engagement and quickly built the critical mass\nneeded to turn Crowd into Community. The TED talks also leveraged the\nexponential nature of cloud services (Leveraged Assets). At the same time,\nthe franchise format of TEDx, supported by the toolkit, created a scalable set\nof optimized processes that allowed this newly created Community to build",

In just a few short years,\nAnderson turned a localized program into a global media brand. Despite its\nrapid growth, however, TED never compromised on the excellence of content\nor the quality of the attendee experience that made it so great in the first place.\nLet’s look at how the ExO attributes were implemented:\nMTP: “Ideas Worth Spreading”\nCommunity & Crowd: Leverage the TED community for\nTEDx events. TED talks have turned millions of casual\nmembers into community.\nAlgorithms: Used to gauge which TED talks to promote on\nmain site.\nInterfaces: Fixed rules about how to create a TEDx event.\nDashboar ds: Live statistics on TEDx events globally.\nExperimentation: Different formats tried and evaluated\n(e.g., within corporations).\nExample 2: GitHubEver since Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 and first established the\n“open source” paradigm, a vast global community has been steadily creating\nnew software for millions of applications. One such initiative, the website\nSourceForge (www.sourceforge.net), has more than 430,000 open source\nprojects on it, some of which have achieved remarkable success.\nAside from Linux itself, perhaps the best-known open source project is the\nApache Web Server, a free piece of software created in 1996 by  a team led by\nopen source guru Brian Behlendorf, which competed with and subsequently\nhumbled mighty Microsoft. Today, Apache runs the majority of the websites\naround the world—a  fact that remains little known. In an illuminating exercise\nconducted in 1998, IBM asked a hundred blue-chip company chief\ninformation officers if they used open source software in their companies. 95\npercent said no. Yet when interviewers asked the same question of those\ncompanies’ systems administrators, 95 percent answered yes, an outcome that\nled IBM to make a major strategic shift into open source. Celebrated—e ven\nrecognized—or  not, open source software runs the Internet (and thus the\nworld) today.\nAfter that extraordinary initial success, the open source movement settled\ninto a stable, stratified environment over much the last decade, with the\ncommunity producing little in the way of new innovation. Everything changed\nin 2008,  however, when Chris Wanstrath, P.J. Hyett and Tom Preston-Werner\n(all out of Paul Graham’s Y Combinator entrepreneurial incubator program)\nfounded a company called GitHub.\nAn open source coding and collaboration tool and platform, GitHub has\nutterly transformed the open source environment. It is a social network for\nprogrammers in which people and their collaborations are central, rather than\njust the code itself. When a developer submits code to a GitHub project, that\ncode is reviewed and commented upon by other developers, who also rate\nthat developer. GitHub’s coding environment has instant messaging embeddedwithin it, along with a distributed version control system (instead of a central\ncode repository). In practice, what that means is you don’t need a server; you\nhave everything you need locally, and can start coding without first needing to\nget permission. And you can do s o anywhere, even offline.\nGitHub has successfully transformed the open source community by\nimplementing virtually all of the ExO principles. The table below shows how\nthe company has implemented an MTP, as well as SCALE and IDEAS:\nMTP: “Social Coding”\nStaff on Demand: GitHub can (and does) leverage the entire\nopen source community for internal work.\nCommunity & Crowd: Thanks to coding lessons and a\ncollaborative environment, new developers (Crowd) are\nquickly turned into users (Community). In addition,\nGitHub has created a new office for any and all\nstakeholders to drop by and contribute or learn. There is\nopen event space available for offline communities to\ngather and organize programs. GitHub explicitly doesn’t\nuse “lock-in” as a tactic, but rather focuses on respecting\nits users and being the best platform in the market space.\nAlgorithms: In GitHub’s system, feedback is codified into\nalgorithms and used for improved version control and\nworkflow.\nLeveraged Assets: GitHub doesn’t own any of the projects\nhosted on its platform, which itself runs on the cloud. The\ncompany does use some of the software from various\nprojects to enhance the platform itself—thus enlisting\nusers into improving their own work environment.Engage ment: Game dynamics are extensively used, with\nleaderboards and a reputation system. This keeps users\nengaged without forcing their participation. Feedback on\nnew code is accomplished in almost real time.\nInterfaces: The company has customized a number of\nfunctions to support its developers, including instant\nmessaging, rating and reputation systems, and software\ncoding lessons. All are embedded within the platform.\nThe core strength of the product is its highly automated\ncontrol mechanism and workflow management, which\nintegrates outputs of different external organizational\nattributes (such as software incentive competitions and\ngamification programs), as well as crowd and community\ndeliverables.\nDashboar ds: GitHub monitors value metrics about the\nplatform. This information is available internally via a\nsophisticated and intuitive control panel.\nExperimentation: Due to its decentralized, responsive,\ntransparent and self-organizing company culture, there is\ncontinuous and open iteration of new ideas in every\ndepartment across the organization. To avoid chaos,\nGitHub has developed open, easy-to-use internal\nplatforms and effective communication. Given the\nfreedom employees have to join any project, they need\nready access to training materials and documentation\nfrom across the organization; without them, switching\nprojects creates too much friction as newcomers struggleto get oriented. In this way, new team members are able\nto be productive from the first day they join a project.\nAutonomy: Authority and decision-making are completely\ndecentralized. Teams self-organize, and the staff for any\ngiven project make the key decisions on that team’s\ninitiatives. That said, everyone in the company is\nencouraged to contribute to and act as advisor on\ndecisions that are being made elsewhere in the\norganization. As a result, the recruiting process is\nprimarily focused on self-starters who have passion,\npurpose, and potential. Within the company, this is called\n“open allocation,” which essentially translates to: always\nwork on stuff you are personally excited about or that you\nfind fulfilling.\nSocial Technologies: With all employees across all\ndepartments using GitHub internally, social constructs\nand technologies are deeply embedded into GitHub’s\nplatform and culture. Indeed, it can be said that every\naspect of the product has a social feature. Thus, the de\nfacto office of the company is the chat room; email is\nused only for sending platform reminders and alerts about\nchanges to the platform. This “conversational culture”\nboos ts team morale and productivity. Senior management\nalso has a motive for enforcing this culture: clear\ncommunication is a top priority in such an experimental,\nnetworked organizational model. Team members rely on\nface-to-face conversations, calls or Hangouts for strategic\ndiscussions, while using GitHub, chat or email for more\noperational work.How well has GitHub don e with this revolutionary, exponential, corporate\nculture?\nIn six years, the company has created a community of more than six\nmillion developers working collaboratively on more than fifteen million open\nsource software projects. Even more important is that in Silicon Valley today,\nsoftware developers’ hiring prospects and even salaries are largely\ndetermined by their individual ratings on GitHub. And because of the power\nand influence of that rating system, developers are constantly adding code to\nGitHub projects in order to boost their personal ratings. This secondary\nbenefit further adds value to the community and the company.\nIn short, GitHub is not only a great example of an Exponential\nOrganization, but its product is also a powerful template for the ExO\norganizational model: collaborative, open, transparent, community-driven and\npeopled by staff well equipped and willing to self-select projects. It also\noffers 10x improvements across the board for different functions, jobs and\ndepartments. Bottom line: GitHub is an emergent organization driven by\npassion and purpose.\nAnd although GitHub is currently optimized for developers, similar\nplatforms will eventually emerge for lawyers, doctors, publicists and other\nprofessionals. The platform has already been extended into enterprise\nsoftware development with a successful paid business model, and can or soon\nwill be used by governments, non-profits and educational institutions. GitHub\ncharges users a monthly subscription—ranging from $7 to $200—t o store\nprogramming source code. Andreessen Horowitz, one of the world’s leading\nventure capital firms, recently invested $100 million in GitHub. It was the VC\nfirm’s largest investment round ever. To understand its rationale, see GitHub’s\nusage by governments around the world (and please spot the exponential\ncurve).",

The example of Coyote Logistics\nshows that these principles can also apply to older, more established\nindustries outside of social networking industries and places like Silicon\nValley—in this case, the dow n-to-earth world of trucking and logistics.\nJeff Silver, a former executive at American Backhaulers, co-founded\nCoyote Logistics with Marianne Silver in 2006. The company took on the\ntransportation and distribution of goods , and by leveraging ExO\ncharacteristics has managed to revolutionize an established, traditionalindustry. Currently employing 1,300 employees and serving 6,000 customers,\nincluding huge global clients such as Heineken, Coyote leverages a network\nof 40,000 c ontracted carriers across the country.\nCoyote has successfully applied ExO principles in the following ways:\nMTP: “Offer the Best Logistics Experience Ever”\nStaff on Demand/Leveraged Assets: The 40,000 carriers\noperating under contract give Coyote extraordinary reach\nwithout the burden of managing a huge staff.\nCommunity & Crowd: Coyote has transformed its 40,000\ncontracted carriers into a community that interacts with\nthe core team via social media and mobile apps.\nAlgorithms: The core ExO innovation at Coyote is the use of\ncomplex, proprietary algorithms to eliminate the problem\nof empty trucks—known as deadheads—which are one of\nthe industry’s biggest logistical headaches. With more\nthan 40,000 trucks in transit at any given time throughout\nthe U.S., it is essential that Coyote pair empty trucks with\ncargo, and its algorithms give the company a competitive\nadvantage over other trucking firms. Estimates suggest\nthat in 2012 alone, Coyote Logistics eliminated 5.5\nmillion empty miles, prevented 9,000 tons of unwanted\nCO exhaust and contributed $9 million back to its\ncustomers.\nInterfaces: Coyote has created numerous customized\nprocesses for managing its contractors, customers and\nfleet. As shown above , these algorithms provide unique\ninsights about matching trucks with cargo—C oyote’s\n“secret sauce.” For recruiting, the company prefers to2hire young college graduates who show passion, attitude\nand personality, and who are completely new to the\nlogistics industry. According to Coyote, this results in a\nworkforce unencumbered by old industry standards and\nprejudices and open to new ideas and methods. To\nstreamline this process, Coyote is adopting a data-driven\nselection management solution created by Hireology, and\nin 2012 hired 400 of 10,000 candidates using Hireology’s\nplatform. New employees receive extensive training and\nare informed of apprenticeship pos sibilities. In short, they\nare the vanguard of the company’s future.\nDashboar ds: The data from all trucks, as well as from a\nproprietary company mobile app, are monitored in real\ntime and are available both to company management and\nthe drivers themselves to help all stakeholders better\ndeliver on the company’s mission and to achieve\nperformance goals.\nSocial Technologies: Internally, the company makes full use\nof social media. Employees are encouraged to\ncommunicate through social media such as Facebook ,\nTwitter, YouTube and LinkedIn, and to support the\ncommunity and charitable organizations through these\naccounts. Externally, Coyote has created its own mobile\napp, CoyoteGO, which streamlines all interactions among\ndrivers, shippers and employees, creating the potential\nfor Coyote to be in contact 24/7 with its carrier fleet, no\nmatter where the trucks are located.",

It was also\nranked No. 1 and No. 4 in Crain’s Fast Fifty, and currently holds the No. 26\nspot on Forbes’ America’s Most Promising Companies list.\nThe MTP Coyote has embraced all but guarantees that it will remain\nhighly customer driven. And it is continuously leveraging emerging technology\nto assure that its customer experience is as seamless and efficient as possible.\nMost employees work in a single 100,000- square-foot company space,\nwhich looks nothing like a traditional trucking company headquarters. The\nvibe is hot young technology startup—fast moving, creative and spilling over\nwith energy. The only difference is that Coyote is not in the business of\ndelivering online games; instead, it delivers real physical goods , via truck, to\nstores and offices around the country. Coyote’s attitude is reflected in the four\nbrand characteristics the company confidently fosters: True, Tenacious,\nTribal, and Smart. It is that attitude—cocky, communal and competent—that\nhelps explain why Coyote Logistics has earned a spot on the Chicago T ribune\nTop W orkplaces list four years in a row.\nExample 4: Studio Roosegaarde\nFounded by Daan Roosegaarde, who calls himself a “hippie with a\nbusiness plan,” Studio Roosegaarde was started in the Netherlands in 2007\nwith the avowed goal of building dreams. Indeed, Roosegaarde refers to his\ncompany as a dream factory (talk about an MTP). His studio is a special mix\nof art, design and poetry, as well as an array of interactive and exponential\ntechnologies.Studio Roosegaarde creates contextual art installations using information-\ncentric technologies such as sensors, nanotech and, most recently, biotech\n(synthetic biology). One example is a smart highway that responds\nautomatically to weather changes. A second is a smog reduction project in\nBeijing that uses captured smog to create carbon rings as a wearable device.\nIf all that sounds more than a little absurd, it’s because it is…until the moment\nit all becomes real.\nThe studio’s initial success was mainly due to its purpose, the physical\nand visceral nature of its projects, and the bold and unique nature of its ideas\n—what Roosegaarde calls MAYA (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable). Over a\nfive-year period, the studio stabilized into a steady state. Revenues in 2007\nwere 50,000 euros (about $60,000)  and over the following six years, the\nstudio hovered around that revenue level. All studio work was handled\ninternally by full-time employees—everything from idea generation and\nprototyping, to pilot and scaling. Processes had become institutionalized and\nstrong habits were formed.\nIn 2012,  Roosegaarde realized that the studio had lost its freewheeling\nartistic spirit and needed recalibration. He buckled down and transformed the\nenterprise, implementing several ExO characteristics, as shown in the\nfollowing table:\nMTP: “Opening the World with Techno Poetry to Humanize\nand Beautify the World”\nStaff on Demand: Heavy dependence on SoD as a creativity\nboos ter.\nInternships are key in SoD: desired attributes include\npassion and a self-starter mentality. Company has been\nbuilt from the bottom-up and is based on its employees.Community & Crowd: Original and smart ways to insource\nideas and vendors to implement future art projects. The\ncompany first launches a simple idea in a low-profile\nmagazine or newspaper via an interview. Next come\ninbound ideas launched via crowd, followed by a TV\nlaunch, and finally a launch via vendors who send\ninbound emails on how to build art projects. Art in\ngeneral—and the studio’s work in particular—has the\npower of pull and allows for sharing intentions that are\nmanifested quickly (intention economy). Fewer resources\nand employees needed; most concept and vendor research\nis crowd-sourced, filtered by passion and commitment.\nAlgorithms: Early installations employed fuzzy logic. Later\nwork personalized, based upon sensors and algorithms.\nNo deep or machine learning.\nLeveraged Assets: Labs in different universities (University\nof Zurich, University of Cambridge, Eindhoven\nUniversity of Technology and Wageningen University).\nShenzhen factories for prototyping and\nmanufacturing/scaling.\nEngage ment: Studio Roosegaarde listens carefully to the\ncommunity and crowd—n ot formally via online\nmarketplaces, but via inbound emails and calls that feed\ndirectly to new ideas and experiments.\nInterfaces: Three people manually process all inbound calls\nand emails to select the best press oppor tunities, people,\nideas and vendors.Dashboar ds: Real-time tracking of cash flow. Company aims\nfor an eighteen-month runway of slack or play money.\nNumber of ideas in every internal conversation are\ntracked and measured, along with emerging themes per\nconversation.\nExperimentation: “Bowling vs. Ping-Pong.” Studio\nRoosegaarde believes strongly in iteration and short\nfeedback cycles, especially with clients and end users.\nBowling is akin to slow, sequential development.\nPrototyping (Ping-Pong) is key.\nAutonomy: No job descriptions. Staff can spend at least 30\npercent of work time on their own projects.\nHard to decentralize art due to its dependency on its\nvisionary founder.\nMoving towards implementing the Holacracy model\n(OKRs, Lean, ope n, transparent).\nSocial Technologies: Activity streams via Viadesk software\nand extensive use of wikis.\nConnected 3D printers and advanced Cisco\nvideoconferencing in Holland and China boos t team\nbonding and creativity.\nGoogle Trends and Social Media Monitoring (Lean\nStartup tool) personalize art installations or expositions\nby country (by culture or memes); such customization is\ncalled Copy Morph.\nIn 2012, Studio Roosegaarde won a high profile incentive competition at\nTEDx Binnenhof.

        "contents": "a Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies designation. Today, the\nstudio’s focus is primarily on ideation and scaling with a much smaller core\nteam, more staff on demand and a great deal of crowdsourcing.\nRevenues in 2014 will top three million euros—a sixtyfold increase over\n2007. For an art studio, with physical products that are less scalable and\nfocused on an experiential authenticity, that is an impressive achievement\nindeed.\nRetrofitting an ExO\nThese four examples help demonstrate that it is possible to embed ExO\nprinciples into pre-existing organizations—and then literally explode their\nperformance. For any reader with lingering doubts about this approach, let’s\nnow look at the work of Robert Goldberg.\nAfter spending a decade building out NBC’s network Internet division and\nthen running the pioneering incubator, Idealab, Goldberg put his skills at the\nservice of others by becoming a venture capitalist and advisor to several\nstartups and other funds. In 2009, he joined Zynga as its first business\nexecutive and headed up the game company’s mergers and acquisition\noperation. As we noted in Chapter Four, over a two-and-a-half year period,\nZynga grew from thirty employees to three thousand, making it one of the\nfastest growing companies ever. That growth was achieved as a result of forty\nacquisitions over just over ten quarters. Amazingly, 95 percent of those\nacquisitions proved successful—an almost unheard-of ratio.\nSo how did Goldberg do it?\nThe primary mechanism used by Zynga to manage growth without diluting\nits culture was the formal application of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)to track teams and keep everyone synchronized. With his arrival, Goldberg\ntook matters a step further by applying these processes to Zynga’s new\nacquisitions…bu t with a twist.\nMost acquisitions fail because the mother company intentionally slows the\nnewly acquired operation in order to better understand it, adapt its internal\noperations to the new order, achieve integration synergies and inculcate the\nnew employees into the company culture. It is an understandable impulse, but\none that almost always confuses and frustrates the new team, resulting in what\nGoldberg calls “impedance mismatch.” That is, the newly arrived team has a\nsense of being stuck at the starting gate—feeling forgotten, ignored or\npunished—a  situation that often leads key people to depart the company.\nGoldberg turned this model upside down. He not only refused to put the\nbrakes on these new acquisitions, but also implemented, with their agreement,\nexpone ntial OKRs. This torrid new pace not only kept the new teams engaged\nand excited, but they even began pulling Zynga forward towards more\nexponential results.\nAfter Zynga went public, Goldberg returned to his investing roots. He\ncreated a new fund, GTG Capital Partners, to apply his landmark thinking to\nother companies and industries. GTG Capital Partners finds early-stage and\nmid-market companies that have stalled in their growth and applies the\nfollowing ExO attributes:\nMTP: Company transforms mission statements and takes on\ngrander visions.\nCommunity & Crowd: Community heavily engaged.\nEngage ment: Online marketing and referral marketing used\nextensively to increase customer engagement.\nAlgorithms: Data science techniques implemented to extract\nnew insights about customers and products.",

If, collectively, they are able to dou ble the company’s\ngrowth rate in that time frame (no mean feat), then an investment is made and a\n10x growth target set. Over the last two years, GTG Capital Partners has\nraised a $100 million fund, systematized its approach and, to date, has\napplied its process to forty companies—an astounding number.\nExample 5: GoPro\nIn 2001,  Nick Woodm an, a passionate surfer, started strapping cameras to\nhis wrists to take shots from his surfboard. After some failed early\nexperiments, Woodm an realized he had to build the waterproof housing. By\n2004, he was building his own cameras, and ultimately came to own the full\ncustomer experience. Although some success came via QVC, the television\nshopping network, sales soon stalled, and there was some minor panic in the\nface of the competing Flip Video camera’s success.\nThe turning point came in 2006,  when friends convinced Woodm an to go\nfully digital, resulting in GoPro producing its first digital video camera. In2008, GoPro introduced a wide-angle lens, but the excitement was short-\nlived; Steve Jobs’ announcement that the iPhone would feature video brought\non a second panic attack. Sales stalled once again and growth flattened. After\nseven hard years, GoPro had plateaued; the company seemed to be going\nnowhere. Meanwhile, Cisco bought Pure Digital, the maker of the Flip\ncamera, for almost $600 m illion.\nWoodm an refused to surrender. Convinced that his market was out there,\nhe continued iterating and innovating. His break finally came in late 2009\nwhen he introduced high definition (HD) video in the GoPro HD Hero.\nMeanwhile, the cost of the camera had droppe d exponentially to the point\nwhere mainstream customers could afford it. When BestBuy began selling\nGoPro cameras in 2010, s ales tripled.\nGoPro now has more than seven hundred employees (it had just eight in\n2010)  and is valued at $3 billion. In 2013, GoPro sold 3.84 million cameras\nand grossed $985.73 million (up 87.4 percent from 2012) . GoPro is currently\nranked No. 39 on Fast Company ’s World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies\nlist, and the company went public in July 2014, a culmination of a remarkable\nrun.\nSo which ExO attributes did GoPro use in 2010 and 2011 to grow\nexponentially after its plateau?\nMTP: “Help People Capture and Share Their Most\nMeaningful Experiences”\nCommunity & Crowd: Users from all over the world share\nfootage on GoPro’s website and Facebook  page, which\ncurrently has 7.5 million likes. Viewers see videos and\nare inspired to create their own. In addition, GoPro has\nbecome an open platform with open APIs. Third-partydevelopers can create additional functionality for GoPro\ndevices.\nAlgorithms: Extensive fuzzy logic embedded in the camera.\nLeveraged Assets: GoPro mostly uses manufacturers and\nsuppliers in China to produce its equipment, relying in\nparticular on Foxconn, which invested $200 million in\nGoPro in December 2012. Foxconn CEO Terry Gou is a\nGoPro advisor.\nEngage ment: GoPro held a “How will you GoPro?” contest.\nParticipants used text and visual to share their dream\nadventures. Of thousands of entries, one winner received\nan all-expense-paid trip worth $30,000. A GoPro film\ncrew accompanied the winner and helped create his\nmotorcycle adventure. The company also has a daily\nincentive competition in which it gives away one of\neverything the company makes.\nExperimentation: Pivots amongst camera quality (HD),\nwhere to use it (use cases), rights management and\ndistribution outlets (Best Buy).\nSocial Technologies: Heavy use of YouTube, Facebook and\nthe historic Felix Baumgartner space jump, which\nreceived 8 m illion views.\nAlthough GoPro has done very well in the last four years, it still faces\nmajor challenges—not the least of which is the slow decline of Best Buy and\nother big box retailers, which are the company’s primary distribution\nchannels. But as an example of a flat company that leveraged ExO attributes to\ntransform itself, it’s hard to find a better example. GoPro easily qualifies as\nan ExO, having increased sales by more than 50x over a five-year period.So, can established companies adopt ExO processes and produce 10x\nresults? The answer, as we have seen in this chapter, is a resounding yes. But\nit is always challenging, and there is no well-marked path for getting there.\nWhen it comes to established companies, every ExO solution is a custom\ncreation.\nExperience has shown that transforming an existing enterprise into an\nExponential Organization requires two things. The first is a company culture\nthat can quickly adapt to rapid, often radical, change. Coyote Logistics\nsucceeded thanks to its comparatively small and focused staff and the fluid\nnature of its clients. Robert Goldberg succeeded at Zynga because he was\nworking with employees and operations brought on board as a result of\nacquisitions, which meant that the workers had no history with their new\nemployer, and thus had no precedents to fall back on. And GitHub was almost\nentirely virtual from the start, so could easily change the requirements for\nparticipation. Needless to say, imposing the ExO model on a more traditional\ncompany—on e with a hardened culture or a rigid managerial hierarchy—is\nmuch more difficult.\nStill, it can be done. We are convinced that any stabilized environment or\nmid-market company can leverage ExO principles and transform itself to\nachieve exponential growth.\nThat leads us to the second requirement for turning an established\ncompany into an exponential one: a visionary leader who has the full support\nof the board and senior management. Accelerating a company to blinding\nspeeds, empowering employees and customers, and emplacing a sophisticated\nand sweeping technical infrastructure takes a leader who not only thinks big\nand acts decisively, but who also has the backing of the most powerful people\nin the company—pe ople who won’t shut the whole thing down once things get\nscary, or when they get a nosebleed. Goldberg’s success at Zynga came not\njust from his own talent and trust in his people, but also from the company’sfearless top management. For established companies wishing to go\nexponential, the character and courage of the board of directors and executive\nrow will often prove more decisive than their competence.\nPerhaps the best example of such leadership today is Elon Musk. With the\nsupport of a strong board and visionary investors like Steve Jurvetson,\nMusk’s tenacity and drive have carried him through extreme tests. Tesla, now\nten years old, saw its growth level off in 2011 and 2012, a nd was on the verge\nof bankruptcy and layoffs for its five hundred employees. After an injection of\nfunds from Jurvetson’s DFJ fund, the company launched the Tesla S, which\nwas named Car of the Year in 2013 by Motor Trend magazine and declared\nthe safest car ever built. Not content to rest on his laurels, Musk next open\nsourced all company patents and is launching a new battery factory (an EExO)\nthat will power other brands. From an ExO perspective, perhaps the most\ninteresting example of 10x improvement is the leverage provided by an\nelectric motor. The drivetrain of the Tesla S has just seventeen moving parts\n—compare that to the several hundred moving parts in a conventional car’s\ndrivetrain. By leveraging an MTP, opening the intellectual property to the\ncommunity and taking advantage of accelerating technologies, Tesla\nrevitalized itself from a stalled mid-market company. Its market cap in the last\nyear has increased from $4 bi llion to ove r $30 bi llion.\nA final word on managing fast-tracked growth comes again from Chip Conley,\nwho created the Joie de Vivre chain of specialty hotels and is now part of\nAirbnb’s senior management team. Conley found that the more information-\nbased we become, the greater the need to rely on rituals and meaning to\nstabilize companies and keep teams motivated. Thus, as ExOs take on larger\nnumbers of employees, individual tasks and functions increasingly need the\ngravity well of an MTP to provide purpose. Although that would seem to addto the burden of bigger companies trying to become ExOs, the fact that\nestablished companies are better at those rituals, stories and legends—the\nglue that holds organizations together—works to their advantage, especially\nwhen they are accelerating exponentially.\nIn the next chapters, we’ll take on the toughest nut of all and look at what\nlarge organizations need to do t o retrofit ExO thinking into their world.CHAPTER EIGHT\nExOs for Large Organizations\nRamez Naam spent thirteen years at software giant Microsoft, leading early-\nstage development for new products, including Outlook, Internet Explorer\nand Bing. In that role, Naam was uniquely positioned to observe not just\nMicrosoft, but many of its clients and competitors—and not just in their high-\ngrowth stages, but also as mature companies.\nIn 2008, Naam had an epiphany. The 20th century had seen the defeat of\ntop-down structures, such as communism and managed economies, by\nbottom-up frameworks, including democracy and capitalism. And yet, he\nrealized, despite this historic lesson, the structure of most corporations\nremained completely hierarchical and top-down.\nNaam also observed that as a result of this top-down focus, the flow of\ninformation in large corporations inevitably followed a slow, circular\nmotion. Information initiated from senior management and slowly cascaded\ndown through the ranks. Eventually, frontline employees used this potentially\nobsolete information to perform a fixed set of scripted tasks. They then\ngathered the results and returned them to the flow, passing the tasks upward\nthrough layers of management until those results eventually reached the\nexecutive boardroom once more. There, new decisions were made—and\nagain a new set of commands was sent dow n through the organization.\nBesides the obviously glacial pace of this process, Naam also noted that\nit actually increased the distance between information and decision-making,",

        "contents": "resulting in the following structural failures:\nInformation moved slowly and insights took a long time to be\nimplemented.\nReality, as with the game of “Telephone,” became distorted at each\npoint of transfer.\nThe flow pattern of the information inevitably bypassed a tremendous\namount of intermediary brainpower and experience.\nThe process often caused organizations to behave in a sociopathic\nmanner, ultimately forcing employees to do things against their better\njudgment.\nWe can generalize the many issues facing large organizations to the\nfollowing three:\nMost focus and attention is internal, not external.\nEmphasis tends to be on technologies with existing expertise;\nconverging technologies or adjacencies tend to be ignored and\nbreakthrough thinking is punished.\nReliance on innovation from inside rather than outside.\nNaam wasn’t the only investigator surprised by what he found in many\nmodern corporations. Jason Yotopou los, who spent several years at SAP as\nexecutive vice president of global research, interviewed senior executives at\nthree dozen multinational companies, ultimately finding himself in agreement\nwith the words of organizational theorist John Seely Brown: “Companies\nmay promote the idea of new business creation, [but] in the end they are all\nin the business of reducing risk and building to scale—which is, of course,\nthe antithesis of entrepreneurship and new ventures.”\nAlong the way, Yotopou los also discovered that the new-business teams\nat these companies were almost always staffed with internal companypersonnel, which almost guaranteed a conservative approach and more-of-\nthe-same outcomes.\nYotopou los’ and Naam’s observations underscore our overall thesis that\ntraditional and large organizational structures simply do not fit the current\n(and certainly not the future) paradigm for organizations. This shouldn’t be\ntoo surprising: disruptive new ideas never map onto the traditional\norganization chart, and mature companies, above  all else, are all about org\ncharts.\nSalim came to the same conclusion back in 2007 as head of Brickhouse,\nYahoo’s internal incubator, specifically during a period when Yahoo was\ncontemplating acquiring Twitter. The problem, he quickly realized, was that\nalthough the young social networking company could be force-fit into any of\nfive different Yahoo business units, ultimately it wouldn’t fit well anywhere.\nWhy? Because Twitter’s product and culture were just too alien to the more-\nestablished company. In addition, it was hard to figure out exactly what\nbusiness Twitter was in—which is as true today as it was then. In the end, the\ndecision not to follow through with the acquisition was more impacted by\norganizational considerations than strategic ones.\nThink back to the Iridium layer story from Chapter One. Its message\nshould serve as a wake-up call to all large and established companies.\nAlready dinosaurs, they’ve been hit by a comet of information and are at\nincreased risk of extinction. Nowhere is this more the case than among\ninsular organizations, regardless of the industry, that rely heavily on\nmanpower or are asset-based. All are subject to the extreme threat of\ndisruption. As Peter Diamandis says, “If you are relying on innovation solely\nfrom within your company, you’re dead.”\nAs we enter what Dave Blakely of IDEO calls “a programmable world,”\nwhat is a large and established organization to do?  Answer: Transform.Transformation isn’t easy, however. A big company is like a supertanker:\nit takes a long time to turn. Nonetheless, it can be done. There are many\nexamples of big companies morphing into new markets over time. For\nexample, Nokia used to be a tire company, Samsung was once a trading\ncompany and Intel got its start in memory chips. GE, a company with a long\nand distinguished history, has repeatedly reinvented itself.\nFew companies, however, are able to transform quickly. Apple and IBM\nare two rare examples of large companies that have successfully undertaken\nan extreme transformation and executed it fairly quickly. And in both cases,\ninspiration grew out of desperation; each company was just a few months\nfrom running out of cash. At the same time, each also enjoyed a charismatic\nand bold leadership that was able to use dire circumstances as an impetus to\nturn the company around.\nAs economist Paul Romer has said, “A good crisis is a terrible thing to\nwaste.” But waste is exactly what most companies do, and the vast majority\nof eleventh-hour turnarounds don’t end well. As we pointed out in the\nIntroduction, the average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has fallen from\nsixty-seven years a century ago to just fifteen years today, and 40 percent of\ntoday’s Fortune 500 c ompanies won’t exist a decade from now.\nClearly, it is not in the best interest of any established company, no matter\nits size or industry, to wait until disaster is at the gate to initiate\ntransformative risks. However, many studies have revealed that the vast\nmajority of corporate transformation projects fail. There are many reasons\nfor these failures: complexity, long project timelines, lack of support from the\ntop, exploding budgets and so on. However, a key structural reason is short-\nterm thinking driven by stock prices and the pressure on quarterly earnings.\nWhen a CEO or senior management team is faced with attempting a risky,\nlong-term transformation versus just keeping the boat steady until their stockoptions vest, the choice defaults to the do-nothing strategy. As a result, a key\nmitigating strategy currently used by many large organizations to slow this\ntrend is regulatory capture. If you can lobby  for favorable legislation, you\ncan protect yourself from external disruption. In 1998, in what critics call the\n“Mickey Mouse Protection Act,” the U.S. Congress voted to extend copyright\nprotection by an additional twenty years—a blow to creativity, and certainly\nnot in the best interest of the general public. Similarly, the cable and phone\ncompanies have aggressively pursued legal action to protect their regional\nmonopolies, even going so far as to sue cities that propos e giving away\nInternet access in an effort to spur economic development.\nIndeed, the nonpartisan United Republic found that the return on\ninvestment for lobby ing is astounding: 5,900 percent for oil subsidies,\n22,000 percent for MNC tax breaks and an astounding 77,500  percent for\nkeeping drug prices high. At these rates, it’s actually fiscally irresponsible\nnot to lobby .\nHowever, we believe that in an ExO era, such tactics are unsustainable,\nparticularly when it comes to the consumer domain. Why? Because of the\namount of time they take. The pace of adoption over the Internet far outruns\nthe regulatory process. For example, by the time taxi agencies and hotels\naround the country woke up to the threats posed by Uber and Airbnb,\nrespectively, the public had already embraced the services enough to make\nlobby ing against them that much more difficult; it was a case of swimming\nagainst the tide. The same is true of other industries, as well—just witness\nthe tension between New Jersey car dealers and Tesla’s direct sales model.\n(There’s a delightful irony in listening to automobile dealerships loudly\nproclaim they’re all about consumer protection.)\nAlong with delaying tactics, there is also a second, equally imperative\nreason not to wait until the last minute to initiate a turnaround: the cure justmight kill you. It is our firm belief that a large company cannot suddenly\nimplement the SCALE and IDEAS processes and turn itself into an ExO\novernight. It is simply too radical a transformation, one that is likely to crush\na company’s core business before it has time to find a new one. And even if\nthe company does manage to institute a new business, the internal stress\ncaused by such radical change will be extreme.\nAt the same time, established companies must transform themselves or\nthey will quickly become obsolete. Despite the well-documented difficulties\nin fostering innovation in large organizations, not to mention the endless\nnumber of innovation consultants waiting in the wings to give often bad and\nconflicting advice, a large company cannot sit by and do nothing. The\nnewspaper industry tried to do j ust that and, well…look at the result.\nIn this new high-metabolism world, where accelerating technologies are\northogonally impacting a greater and greater number of industries, large\norganizations need strategies to more closely align themselves with ExO\nthinking. We have identified four such strategies for large organizations to\ndeploy in an accelerating business world while still keeping their core\noperational businesses intact:\n1. Transform leadership.\n2. Partner with, invest in or acquire ExOs.\n3. Disrupt[X].\n4. Implement ExO Lite internally.",

Transform Leadership\nThere are four ways to transform the leadership layers of a big company:\nEducation\nAs we noted in Chapter One, the metabolism of the economy is\naccelerating, driven by a new breed of newly democratized, exponential\ntechnologies. If you’re running a big company today and are not aware of\nthese technologies—not to mention how they might impact your company—\nyou are simply not doing your job.

Every six months, eighty Fortune 500 C-Level executives\nreceive two days of briefings on accelerating technologies, followed by two\ndays of seminars introducing ExO-style organizational tools, including case\nstudies, interviews and practice sessions on incentive prizes.\nBefore attending the program, 75 percent of the executives said they had\nlittle or no awareness of the technologies involved. After the program, 100\npercent said they had already formulated immediate action items regarding\nthose technologies. Even more dramatically, 80 percent of executives agreed\nthat the newly understood breakthroughs would have a game-changing impact\non their businesses within two years, with the remaining 20 percent confident\nthe impact would be felt within five years.\nRecommendation: Bring in outside sources to update your\nsenior management and board on accelerating technologies.\nBoard Management\nThe education requirement for senior leadership applies even more to\nboard members, as they are even less likely to be technologically up to date.\nHow can the board guide a CEO if it is not aware of the potentially\ndisruptive changes the company faces?\nNot surprisingly, smart CEOs are already setting up sessions geared\ntoward helping board members come to grips with the new realities of an\nexponential world. In fact, one astute European CEO makes a point of\nsending his most staunchly traditional and backward-looking board members\nto training programs like those held at SU. His reasoning is that because the\nboard members are the ones slowing progress, it is of the utmost urgency to\ndisrupt their outmoded convictions and ideologies.The good news is that not all board members hold such a narrow\nworldview; many, in fact, are remarkably enlightened. Yuri van Geest found\nthat the forty most influential board chairs of large Dutch corporations were\nmore aware of accelerating disruption than were their CEOs. He credited\nthose board chairs with having a broader, pan-organizational perspective,\nnoting that while CEOs need to focus on the business at hand, board members\nwere free to look to the horizon and consider the larger picture.\nThe greater awareness among board members, especially once they’ve\nbeen trained, helps them to more fully support CEOs as they retool their\norganizations to adapt to an accelerating world. If a CEO isn’t fully\nempowered by the board or given requisite cover, he or she will not be able\nto take the necessary steps to introduce change, and the resulting inaction will\nput the entire organization at risk.\nThe bottom line is that it takes everyone at the top, working together in\nfull agreement about the threats facing the company, to achieve a shared\nvision and pull off a successful transformation of the organization.\nA complement to boa rd education is better management. As Jaime Grego-\nMayor of Advisory Board Architects has noted, fully 95 percent of boards\nare not procedurally managed at all, despite the enormous value that well-\nconnected board members can add. If ExOs are using OKRs to measure and\ntrack the performance of teams and senior management, then surely their\nboard members, who arguably have the highest potential impact on the\ncompany, should be tracked and managed as well.\nRecommendations: Educate the board so that it is equipped\nto buy into the CEO’s plan for radical change. In addition,\ntrack your board using OKRs.",

Yet most large organizations have painfully\nuniform layers of C-suite executives and board members, many of whom\nhave attended the same business schools. Others come from an older\ngeneration and don’t understand new technologies—including, sometimes,\nemail.\nMost Nobel Prize winners do their formative work in their mid- to late-\ntwenties. The average age of the NASA engineers in the Apollo program was\n27. Many of the founders of the dot-com era were in their early twenties. Yet\nmost companies hold to the belief that the more senior the executive, the\nbetter understanding he or she has of the marketplace. In a fast-changing\nworld, that suppos ition is no longer valid.\nOne of the recommendations Salim gives large-company CEOs is that\nthey find the smartest 25 year olds in their organizations and have them\nshadow leadership positions to help close generational and technological\ngaps, accelerate their learning curve in management and provide reverse\nmentorship. Young leaders are desperately needed, and soon. In the new\ntechnology world, where organizations are dealing with market dynamics\nnever before seen, experience as we’ve always defined it can hold a\ncompany back. Sebastian Thrun, CEO of Udacity and a driving force behind\nthe Google car, recently said, “When I’m hiring employees today,\nimagination is much more important than experience.”\nHoward Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, showed his understanding of this\nconcept by appointing Clara Shih to his board.

In 2012, the Credit Suisse\nResearch Institute finished a six-year study of companies with greater than\n$10 billion market capitalization. One of its findings was that value of\ncompanies with all-male boards underperformed those of mixed-gender\nboards by an astounding 26 percent. Vivek Wadhwa, a noted journalist and\nco-author of the book  Innov ating Women: The Changi ng Face of\nTechnology, has been championing this idea for several years now, fearlessly\nhighlighting and showcasing companies with poor  diversity ratios.\nRecommendations: Break up bastions of old-line thinking\nand replace them with individuals and teams offering\ndiversity in terms of experience and perspective. Remember\nthat one of the most important aspects of diversity requires\nputting young people into positions of power and influence.\nIn addition, include more women on your board.\nSkills and Leadership\nWhile at SAP, Jason Yotopou los observed that large companies often fail\nto recognize that there are different types of employees, and that each type is\noptimally suited for different roles within the company. These include:\nOptimizers: Run large businesses at scale and squeeze efficiency to\nmaximize profits.\nScalers: Take a proven model and grow it.\nEvangelists: Champion new ideas and move projects from the idea\nstage to initial commercialization.Companies frequently make the mistake of taking their best performers\nfrom one area and moving them to another, expecting them to perform equally\nwell. For example, a manager might ask an Optimizer to become an\nEvangelist, a role for which the employee may be utterly unsuited, either\ntemperamentally or in terms of skills. The manager then wonders why a top\nperformer failed so spectacularly. What is really required, however, is to tap\nthose iconoclast Evangelists from the inside, the ones who know the\ncorporation’s unique assets and capabilities (which constitute the company’s\nunfair advantage in entering new markets), and ask them to shape a new ExO\nat its edge.\nSuch arbitrary management decision-making—dropping people into slots\nfor which they aren’t suited—a lmost never works. And in the world of ExOs,\nit can be particularly catastrophic because successful leadership in an ExO\nworld looks profoundly different from successful leadership in enterprises\nfounded before, say, 2008. Rob Nail, CEO and Associate Founder of\nSingularity University, has examined leadership qualities in detail and\ndetermined six traits characteristic of ExO leaders:\n1. Visionary Customer Advocate: In a period of rapid transition, it is\neasy for organizations and their products to stray from the originally\nsuccessful connection they had with their customers/clients. Having the\nleader of the organization as the ultimate owner of this understanding\nand priority assures that it is consistently represented. Steve Jobs is a\ngood example of a Visionary Customer Advoc ate who had access to\nextraordinary capabilities and new technologies, and who personally\nstayed involved in decisions regarding every aspect of the customer\nexperience. If customers see their needs and desires being attended to at\nthe highest levels, they are much more willing to persevere through the\nchaos and experimentation that often comes with exponential growth.2. Data Driven Experimentalist: To create order out of high-speed chaos\nrequires a process-oriented approach that is ultimately nimble and\nscalable. The Lean Startup approach can be applied at any scale to\nquickly iterate and build institutional knowledge. We have many social\ntools and other vehicles to maintain incredible connections with our\ncustomers and community. When engaged properly, customers are not\njust likely to be flexible with the process, they may even be excited or\ndemand to be part of it. However, without a data-centric approach,\nentailing rapid feedback and timely progression of a product or service,\ncustomers will become frustrated and, ultimately, disengage.\n3. Optimistic Realist: When scaling rapidly, striving to understand and\nquantify the reality of a situation or oppor tunity is critical to navigation.\nWhen staring in the face of reality, however, some interpretation is\nalways needed. Leaders able to articulate a positive outcome through\nany scenario, even downside scenarios, will be able to help maintain\nobjectivity within their teams. Rapid growth and change may well be\nexciting for some, but most people generally find transformation\ndisconcerting and difficult to adapt to. An overly pessimistic leader can\nexacerbate the fight or flight response, ultimately leading to poor\ndecision-making.\n4. Extreme Adaptability: As a business scales and its activities morph,\nso too must its management. For leaders to oversee long periods of\naccelerated growth, they must transform their focus and adapt their\nskills accordingly. It is rare to find a leader who can transform\nexponentially along with the technology and organization, so with\ndisruption of business models comes the oppor tunity/requirement to\nadapt/change the leadership. Constant learning is critical to staying on\nthe exponential curve.\n5. Radical Openness: A tremendous oppor tunity exists to embrace experts\noutside the organization. Unfortunately, along with this oppo rtunity\ncomes the challenge of having to interact with a large and diverse",

While many leaders and\norganizations ignore most of the criticism and suggestions, creating an\nopen channel to the crowd and the mechanisms to determine signal from\nnoise can provide new perspectives and solutions, allowing access to\nwhole new layers of innovation.\n6. Hyper-Confident: In order to live on the exponential curve and not get\ncaught in the linear mindset of organizational bureaucracy, you must be\nwilling to be fired or even fire yourself. Battles must be fought and\nnaysayers overcome, and that requires extreme selflessness and self-\nconfidence if a leader is to push to the edge. Two of the most important\npersonality traits for an exponential leader to have are the courage and\nperseverance to learn, adapt and, ultimately, disrupt your own business.\nRecommendations: Keep diversity in mind when appointing\nto gove rnance and advisory boards. Regularly take your\nsenior leadership through a personal transformation\nprogram. Examine your own leadership skill sets. Remove\nanyone who puts his or her own career ahead of the success\nof the enterprise.\n2. Partner with, Invest in or Acquire ExOs\nFrom 1990 to about 2005, there were at least five major disruptions in\nthe retail or CPG industry. Three of them—EPOS systems with point-of-sale\ntransactions, RFID tags for supply chain management, and customer loyalty\ncards—produced a significant amount of new data that fundamentally\nchanged the industry.Marcus Shingles, a principal at Deloitte Consulting, and his research\nteam spent most of 2012 helping the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association\n(GMA) analyze the CPG industry for potential Big Data innovation\ndisruptions of the same magnitude. To his surprise, he and his team identified\nhundreds of startups with industry-specific solutions, of which eighty had\nleveraged emerging technologies. Of those eighty companies, thirty were\nalready showing signs of having a similarly disruptive impact as the three\nmajor disruptions outlined above .\nIn other words, while just a few major changes at the turn of the century\nturned the CPG industry upside down over the course of fifteen years, today\nthere are six to ten times as many potential disruptions waiting in the wings,\nall of which have emerged in the last few years. To understand the\nimportance of this sea change for the world of business—any business—it’s\nimportant to keep in mind that the CPG field is generally less innovation-\nsavvy compared to the larger and newer technology leaders, and is far\nremoved from the hipster-driven, hyper-speed world of Silicon Valley. In\nthis day and age, clearly, it’s not just cutting-edge companies that need to\nwatch their backs.\nShingles took the exercise a step further and looked at how the largest\nCPG incumbents viewed those thirty most-disruptive startups. He found that\nthere were a few big companies—the 1 percent of industry players who are\nalways ahead of the rest and continually innovating—that were not only\ntracking the startups, but had actually created partnerships with many of them.\nMeanwhile, the less forward-thinking CPGs hadn’t even heard of the\ncompetitive threats, much less considered them. Not surprisingly, the asleep-\nat-the-wheel companies were astonished when GE partnered with Quirky in\nMay 2013, a partnership that allowed Quirky inventors access to GE’sprodigious patent portfolio. (In fact, GE led Quirky’s $80 million investment\nround in November 2013.)\nIt’s this type of thinking that separates leaders from followers within\nindustries. Shingles and his Deloitte Innovation team are now talking to many\nindustry groups about similar sweeps in their areas.\nAs we stated in Chapter Five, disruption is the new norm. Throughout\nevery industry, the democratization of accelerating technologies is allowing\nhundreds of startups to attack and disrupt traditional markets: Bitcoin, Uber,\nTwitch, Tesla, Hired, Clinkle, Modern Meadow, Beyond Verbal, Vayable,\nGitHub, WhatsApp, Oculus Rift, Hampton Creek, Airbnb, Matternet,\nSnapchat, Jaunt VR, Homejoy, Waze, Quirky, Tongal, BuzzFeed—the list of\ndisruptors is virtually endless. And while of course many newcomers won’t\nsucceed, their sheer number means that plenty will be around long enough to\ncreate a revolution.\nLarge companies must identify and track disruptive ExOs with the aim of\nobserving, partnering with, investing in and/or acquiring them. And they must\ndo so as early as possible to lower the investment threshold needed and to\npre-empt the competition. The perfect moment to engage with an ExO is\nwhen the startup has real traction and is just emerging as a market leader. A\nclassic example of such timing took place in 2005 when Google bought\nYouTube for $1.6 billion. YouTube had already out-executed Google Video\nand other competitors, and was gobbling up market share. Google picked up\nYouTube just before the company broke out, and was thus able to bring in its\nown muscle to help accelerate that once-threatening expansion.\nAs with the example of GE and Quirky outlined above , Allstate Insurance\nis another example of a traditional company in a mature industry that was\nforward-thinking enough to see the writing on the wall. A few years ago,\nafter identifying and tracking the startups in Allstate’s space, CEO TomWilson concluded that the biggest threat came from new online insurance\ncompanies like Geico and Esurance, which could seriously threaten\nAllstate’s countrywide network of agents and offices. Instead of resorting to\nthe watch-and-hope strategy most CEOs adopt, Wilson went out aggressively\nand acquired Esurance in 2011. Equally important, rather than trying to\nintegrate the newcomer into its existing business, Allstate was smart—and\nbrave—enough to leave it as an independent entity, and the bigger company\nis now learning from the startup.\nThe real question then is not whether to acquire an ExO, but when to\npartner with an ExO, when to invest in one and when to acquire it.\nYotopou los, who created the Acquisition Strategy group at SAP, describes\nthe need to carefully select among the various “tools in the toolbox”—bu ild,\nbuy, partner and invest—when it comes to execution on disruptive market\noppor tunities. Each oppor tunity is shaped differently, and for this reason, one\nsize does not fit all. Instead, a more holistic approach is required.\nA corporation should look to create an internal ExO when:\n1. An oppo rtunity is one to two adjacencies away from the company’s core\nbusiness—pe rhaps a different business model, buyer, user or go-to\nmarket.\n2. Urgency is low—there is still time until the market’s inflection point.\n3. The company is able to hire the necessary talent. This approach\ntypically maximizes control and minimizes costs for those markets that\nmust be “owned” given their strategic nature.\nAcquisition is usually the most appropriate path when a market is\nstrategically imperative to “own” but you face the following obstacles:\n1. It is difficult to hire the right talent.\n2. The market inflection point is upon you.",

        "contents": "Inspire ExOs at the Edge\nCreating ExOs at the edge of your organization is no easy task, as\nGoogle’s Sebastian Thrun makes clear: “When you’re in a company and your\nmain product is search and every time you’re doing an experiment you risk\nlosing—I don’t know—a few million or one hundred million people, then\nexperimentation is really hard. Breaking out into fields that the company\nhasn’t entered before is much easier.”\nWhen SAP bought TopTier in 2001, rather than trying to integrate founder\nShai Agassi into the organization, where he would have been lost, the\ncompany instead put him at the edge of the organization and let him loose.\nAllowed to remain in his favored role as maverick, Agassi zeroed in on the\nSAP developer community, quickly realizing its untapped potential. Within\ntwo years he had created a two-million-strong developer network, a major\nasset for the company to this day.\nIn every organization, there are always changemakers like Agassi: highly\ncreative, self-starting individuals who don’t fit neatly into a box. Constrain\nthem in that box and they can sow considerable chaos. Changemakers have\nbrilliant ideas and vision—and are often fiercely loyal to the company—bu t\nthey are frustrated by limitation. Eventually, after being held back by\ninterminable management layers and bureaucratic processes, they get fed up\nand leave, or are fired. Prime examples of this phenomenon are ex-Google\nemployees Ev Williams, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Ben Silbermann and\nKevin Systrom, all of whom founded startups (Twitter, FourSquare, Pinterest\nand Instagram, respectively) after leaving Google. Google is a hugely\nsuccessful company, of course, but imagine where it would be today if those\nextraordinary individuals had stayed. (And Google has a better track record\nthan most companies.)It is critical, then, for big companies to locate change agents before their\nfrustrations grow too deep, and re-assign them to the edges of the\norganization and give them free reign to build ExOs. This will not only\nleverage the strengths of the changemakers, it will also maintain stability at\nthe heart of the organization. Furthermore, if the process is handled well and\nthe outcome is positive, cutting-edge ExOs can serve as tugboats for the\ncorporate supertanker, guiding it into new and profitable waters. Eventually,\nif successful, these fast-moving peripheral enterprises will themselves create\na new center and, ultimately, replace the legacy business. Some retailers\nhave successfully accomplished the creation of edge EExOs. Companies like\nMacy’s, Burberry, Target and Wal-Mart all created ecommerce sites outside\nand independent of their core organization and only started integration once\nthe EExO had reached critical mass. In fact, we recommend that once\nsuccessful, the legacy bricks and mortar business should report into the\nEExO, as that is the clear future. Similarly, many luxury fashion brands have\nwhite labeled Yoox, the giant Italian ecommerce site, to get to market\nquickly.\nJohn Hagel, co-chairman of the aptly named Center for the Edge, and his\nteam have developed a promising new approach to large-scale\norganizational change that he calls “Scaling Edges.” The methodology behind\nScaling Edges is built on the following basic guidelines:\nFind an edge in the form of an emerging business oppor tunity that has\nthe potential to scale quickly and become a new core for the business.\nLine up a changemaker (or team of changemakers) who understands and\nembraces that edge oppor tunity.\nPlace the changemaker/team of changemakers outside the core\norganization.Use the Lean approach and experiment with new initiatives to\naccelerate learning.\nStarve the team by providing little in the way of help, money or other\nresources.\nEncourage the team to seek leverage by connecting with other\ncompanies and participating in an ecosystem that can help accelerate\ngrowth.\nPoint the ExO outward. The fledgling enterprise should create a new\nmarket or product area, NOT cannibalize the core product suite—at\nleast in its early stages.\nThe rationale for these last three elements is that you do not want to\nawaken what Salim calls the immune response, so to speak, of the core\norganization. If the mother company senses that too many resources are being\nfunneled to the new initiative, it will evoke a reaction (the notorious\n“corporate antibodies”) and the body  will attack and try to kill the startup.\nOne explicit step we would add to Hagel’s list is to leverage data. Most\nlarge organizations have extraordinary insights and value locked up in their\ndata stores, and leveraging those insights (which Hagel would label as an\nEdge) offer some low-hanging fruit for edge ExOs to exploit. Wassili\nBertoen, managing director of the Center for the Edge Europe, notes that in\nhis seventeen years of dealing with corporate innovation, he has observed\nthat most large companies have huge unlocked potential—in fact, they’re\nbegging for a structured outlet for it all.\nWhen building out Yahoo’s Brickhouse incubator in 2007, Salim put\ntogether a team of developers, some from within Yahoo, others from the\noutside. It was, briefly, one of the best development teams in the world\n(certainly everyone at Yahoo wanted to work there). But Yahoo wanted\nBrickhouse to build new products and services for the core organization\nrather than to create new markets for the company. Needless to say, withinweeks of Brickhouse’s launch, all vestiges of autonomy at Brickhouse had\ndissolved, and feelings of jealousy and resentment toward the newcomer\nswept through the company. (“Why do they get the best employees?” “Are\nthey competing with my product?”). By the end of his tenure, Salim was\nspending 80 pe rcent of his time fending off the company in an effort to protect\nhis Brickhouse teams. Clearly a no-win situation for all parties.\nEventually, in 2008, in the wake of an attempted Microsoft purchase,\nYahoo killed Brickhouse despite it having, against all odds , launched several\nproducts that truly pushed the edges of the consumer Internet. And although\nYahoo’s immune system won that particular battle, the company ultimately\nlost the war. (Since that time, however, Salim has spent time with the new\nsenior management and is encouraged by what CEO Marissa Mayer and\nCMO Kathy Savitt are aiming for.)\nYotopou los fared better at SAP because the new businesses created in\nthat company’s Global Business Incubator were fully sheltered throughout the\ntenure of three CEOs. Another factor contributing to their success was that\nthe new companies also had a good s prinkling of ExO attributes, including:\nFull-decision autonomy with distinct processes and procedures.\nSmall, agile and bootstrapped cross-functional startup teams\nresponsible for building new businesses from the idea stage through to\ncommercialization.\nThe ability to iterate on multiple types of innovation (business model,\ngo-to-market, etc.) beyond traditional product level innovation.\nIterative in-market testing of prototypes to customers with a goal of\naccelerated learning.\nIvan Ollivier, Director of Nissan’s Future Lab, has similarly set up his\nunit in Silicon Valley, far away from headquarters, where he is exploring a",

Another strategy, one that builds on the creation of Edge ExOs and\npartnerships with ExOs, is for a big company to assemble a team specifically\ndesigned to disrupt itself. The idea is to hire a team of young, digitally\nnative, self-starting Millennials and charge them with the task of setting up a\nstartup whose sole purpose is to attack the mother ship. Part of the\nassignment is that the team must interact with the external community to\nidentify oppor tunities all-but-invisible from inside the company.\nThe cutting-edge design firm IDEO undertook just such an exercise a few\nyears ago. Noting that the company’s design processes and techniques were\nthen widely understood by the market, the senior management team realized\nthat the company was dangerously open to disruption. Thinking proactively, it\ninvited Tom Hulme, one of its own managers, to form a team and take on the\nchallenge of disrupting IDEO itself. The result was OpenIDEO, a fascinating\nopen source version of the company that created an entirely new capability\nthat, in the end, complemented IDEO’s core offering.\nAdmittedly, this step requires a considerable amount of courage and\ngumption. But isn’t that what leadership is all about? And if you are a big",

In this way, two\nperspectives are brought to the table and bets are hedged.\nCisco Systems, for example, has always operated in an environment of\nunpredictable standards, one in which the market can suddenly tip from one\ntechnology standard to another. As a hedging strategy, Cisco funds new\ninternal businesses focused on the current standard that Cisco prefers. At the\nsame time, Sequoia Capital, its original venture capital vehicle, finances an\noutside team—on e often staffed by former Cisco employees—that is\ndedicated to pursuing the competing standard. (The alternate firm has a pre-\nagreed-upon purchase price from Cisco in case the market tips in the other\ndirection.) In this way, Cisco both covers its bases and maintains its agility\nin an uncertain marketplace. And at Netflix, a system called Chaos Monkey\ndeliberately and randomly disrupts the service’s application infrastructure to\nensure that developers have accounted for all possible error states.\nRecommendation: Hire both internal and external Black Ops\nteams and have them establish startups with a combined goal\nof defeating one another and disrupting the mother ship.\nCopy Google[X]\nAt a Singularity University event three years ago, Larry Page told Salim\nhe’d heard good things about Brickhouse and asked whether Google shouldset up something similar. Salim’s recommendation was no; he believed it\nwould only evoke the same immune system response he’d experienced at\nYahoo.\nPage’s response was cryptic: “What would a Brickhouse for atoms look\nlike?” he asked.\nWe now know what he meant. In launching the Google[X] lab, Google\nhas taken the classic skunkworks approach to new product development\nfurther than anyone ever imagined. Google[X] offers two fascinating new\nextensions to the traditional approach. First, it aims for moonshot-quality\nideas (e.g., life extension, autonomous vehicles, Google Glass, smart contact\nlenses, Project Loon, etc.). Second, unlike traditional corporate labs that\nfocus on existing markets, Google[X] combines breakthrough technologies\nwith Google’s core information competencies to create entirely new markets.\nWe strongly recommend that every big company attempt something\nsimilar by creating a lab that is a playground for breakthrough technologies.\nIt should then conduct ongoing experiments with new products and services,\nwith a goal of creating entirely new markets for the company. Equally\nimportant is protecting that lab (especially during slow times) from the\n“antibodies” within the organization, as they will inevitably argue that the lab\n—the alien body —has an insufficient ROI. Last but not least, pay attention\nto the lab’s discoveries. Great ideas always come from crossing disparate\nareas.\nThe core competencies of a large organization combined with new\ntechnology breakthroughs create a potent force that can generate a new future\nfor many big legacy companies. Probably the gold standard in this respect is\n3M, which over the years has delivered extreme autonomy to its researchers\nand, as a result, has repeatedly created breakthrough products in new markets\n—the ubiquitous Post-it note being a prime example.",

Looking at large companies from an ExO perspective, let’s\nconsider four examples:\nTechShop\nWe first examined TechShop’s fascinating model in Chapter\nThree. Here we’ll explore the chain’s impact in further detail,\nfocusing on how TechShop is helping large organizations,including Ford and Lowe’s, two companies for which it has\nbuilt individual facilities.\nTechShop’s CEO Mark Hatch offers Fortune 500 CTOs a\ncompelling pitch: “Give me 1 percent of R&D and 1 percent of\nyour staff and I’ll return you 10x.” It’s a lofty goal, but Hatch’s\ntrack record matches the rhetoric. The founders of Solum, Inc.,\nwhich specializes in GPS-based nitrogen detection for\nagriculture, used TechShop’s facilities to carry them from\nconcept through four generations of product development,\nraising $1 million in just fourteen weeks. TechShop has seen\nseveral other business clients achieve $1 million in sales just\nthree months after launch. To put that time frame into\nperspective, consider that some large organizations take three\nmonths just to approve one step of a stage-gate process.\nSingularity University Labs\nA steady stream of corporate executives pass through\nSingularity University in search of their Holy Grail: any\nmechanism to manage disruptive innovation. In response, SU has\ncreated a laboratory designed to enable corporate innovation\nteams to reside full-time at SU’s open innovation campus so that\nthey can collaborate and partner with SU’s portfolio of startups\nand its faculty. Each SU startup aims to leverage accelerating\ntechnologies to positively impact a billion people. SU’s faculty\nincludes the world’s leading experts, practitioners and\nresearchers in eight accelerating technologies. Organizations\nalready on board include Coca-Cola, UNICEF, Lowe’s and\nHershey’s.A comment from a recent participant captures the essence of\nthe program: “Access to world experts in exponential\ntechnologies and organizations ensures we’re thinking beyond\nnext quarter’s earnings report—way beyond. Most of the\nCorporate Innovation Exchange members are here to drive\ndisruption within our own companies—be fore two kids in a\ngarage do it for us.”\nmach49\nYotopou los, who also created SAP’s Global Business\nIncubator, has capitalized on that unique experience, combining\nit with his decade-long background as a Silicon Valley venture\ncapitalist. He and Linda Yates, a seasoned CEO and public\nboard member with over twenty years experience driving\nstrategy and innovation in the Global 1000, are implementing\nseveral ExO principles to help global companies create new,\n“adjacent” businesses generated from within their organization.\nThey intend to offer facilities, Valley networks and a seasoned\nteam of executives familiar with both the corporate and startup\nworlds to jumpstart new corporate businesses—and to do so by\nleveraging resources that the corporation itself does not (and\nperhaps cannot) own.\nYotopou los and Yates start by leveraging the corporation’s\ncrowd in an incentive competition to see which internal\nentrepreneurs propos e the most compelling business\noppor tunities. The winning teams get all-expense-paid trips to\nmach49’s Silicon Valley facility. There, they are paired with\nnon-competitive teams from other industries. All the groups are\nthen immersed in Lean startup-style entrepreneurship and designthinking. The goal is to validate business oppor tunities through\nprototypes and in-market tests.\nAfter working alongside the mach49 team and network, these\nsmall, multi-disciplinary teams of corporate intrapreneurs leave\nwith defined, validated oppor tunities and a clear execution plan.\nThey can then stay on in Silicon Valley to accelerate, be spun\nback into (or out of) the mother ship, or serve as pilots to pave\nthe way to larger acquisitions or partnerships. While it’s early\ndays yet, we think the model holds extraordinary promise.\nH-Farm (Treviso, Italy)\nMaurizio Rossi, a seasoned entrepreneur, created H-Farm in\n2005 with Internet veteran Ricardo Donadon. Their aim was to\ncreate an atelier for “digital artisans” at a countryside facility\noutside Venice. There, in forty-two buildings dotting a former\nfarm, Rossi and Donadon run educational courses, hackathons\nand design competitions. The program has grown to house 450\nentrepreneurs and developers, and the pair hopes to double that\nnumber within two years. The majority of their teams are made\nup of entrepreneurs, but about a third are composed of corporate\naccelerators who sign on for one-year memberships.\nH-Farm also runs monthly hackathons for large companies,\nand winners are hosted onsite to build out their ideas. One\ncreative H-Farm project comes from Porsche, which invites\ncustomers to the farm for pitch sessions in which Porsche\nowners can investigate and possibly even invest in great\nstartups. Talk about the ultimate customer-purchasing bonus.The incubator operations listed above  are just a few examples of what is\nproving to be a broad trend. Similar ExO-oriented incubators are springing\nup in countries all over the world: Communitech and OneEleven in Ontario;\nSociaLab, with several offices throughout South America; Start-Up Chile, in\nSantiago; and Thinkubator, which is headquartered in Copenhagen. Google\nhas been especially busy, partnering with Startup Weekend and Women 2.0 in\nthe U.S., iHub in Kenya and Le Camping in France.\nEveris, a multinational consulting firm based in Madrid, has partnered\nwith two Spanish entrepreneurs, Luis Gonzalez-Blanch and Pablo De Manuel\nTriantafilo, to create mentoring software that matches executives in big\ncompanies with startups in their internal incubators. Everis, which intends to\noffer the service to hundreds of clients across Spain, is looking to push\nconsulting into the new economy of open-talent, accelerating innovation,\nconnected knowledge, Big Data, intelligent currency and pervasive\nentrepreneurship. In each field, a likely roadmap and database have already\nbeen created. In entrepreneurship, for example, the company has created the\nbiggest B2B ICT startup database in the world. It lists 63,000 entrepreneur\nsupport organizations, is currently trawling through the APIs of over six\nhundred websites and has analyzed ove r half a million startups and SMEs.\nEach partnership listed above  is further evidence of our belief that large\norganizations can create successful partnerships with local, grassroots\nbusiness accelerators. Business Integration Partners (BIP), a global\nconsulting firm based in Italy, even has a “Corporate Accelerator in a Box”\nservice. BIP has helped several blue-chip clients set up their own operation\nwith recruiting, VC connections and university partnerships. This service\ncomes complete with process management and software to help run incentive\ncompetitions and manage open source projects.",

When it comes to startups we prefer to see an 80\npercent failure rate, with 20 percent presenting game changing ideas.\nHowever, when we looked at the countries in which Wayra has spearheaded\nthe creation of entrepreneurship communities—in many cases, emerging\nmarkets where none existed previously—the phrase “walk before you run”\ncame to mind.

Physical assets don’t scale exponentially, but\ndigitized assets lead to new use cases, partners, ecosystems, rules and\nbusiness models. If you want to be truly disruptive, an information\ncomponent is critical. Smart companies are already using services such as\nKaggle, Palantir, Cloudera, DataTorrent, Splunk and Platfora for data\ninsights; they’re also using open source machine learning variations of\nApache Hadoop .

Unilever also leverages eYeka to host competitions\nfor its portfolio brands, such as Clear, Lipton and Cornetto, among others.\nDashboards\nExtending the notion that decision-making in companies should be driven\nby data rather than by intuition, Dashboards offer an intuitive way to present\ncomplex information in a simple and cogent way.\nJohn Seely Brown and John Hagel have observed that although all of our\nlarge organizations are set up to scale efficiencies, in this new economy what\nwe actually need to scale is learning. And while some very good business\nintelligence (BI) systems exist out there, they are set up largely to measurescaling of efficiency. What is needed now are new dashboards that measure\nthe learning capability of organizations. And if those learning dashboards\ndon’t emerge soon, big companies should consider requiring that their newly\nminted chief data officers (the hottest new C-Level position) build them.\nWhat, exactly, should learning Dashboards track? Here are a few\nsuggestions:\nHow many (Lean Startup) experiments or A/B-tests did Customer\nService run last week? Marketing? Sales? HR?\nHow many innovative ideas have been collected over the past year?\nHow many have been implemented?\nWhat percentage of total revenues is driven by new products from the\nlast three years? The last five years?\nObjectives and Key Results (OKRs) are also important metrics for\ncorporations, even though OKRs are most important in new startups where\nhigh growth rates in employment necessitate a shorter feedback loop cycle.\nBut big companies also need them because OKRs:\nEncourage disciplined thinking (major goals will surface).\nIncrease effective communication (everyone learns what is important).\nEstablish indicators for measuring progress (shows how far along\ncompany is).\nFocus effort (and thus synchronize the organization).\nIn 2008, Jeff Weiner, the new CEO of LinkedIn, introduced OKRs to the\ncompany, with a goal of enabling all employees to align themselves with\nLinkedIn’s mission, as well as to provide a flexible, hands-off mechanism for\ntracking progress. This one move is widely regarded as a key reason why\nLinkedIn became a $20 bi llion company.It is our opinion that in the future, the defining metric for organizations\nwon’t be ROI (Return on Investment), but ROL (Return on Learning). Kyle\nTibbits recently took this notion to the level of the individual employee\nwhen he observed, “The most valuable compensation for working at a startup\nas oppos ed to a ‘normal job’ is a dramatically higher rate of learning\n(ROL).”\nDuleesha Kulasooriya of the Center for the Edge sees innovation in big\ncompanies as a measurement issue. Niall Daly, a former management\nconsultant and Founder/CFO of Backpocket, concurs, noting that, “With\ndisruptive innovation, you have to measure non-linear effects as oppos ed to\nlinear accounting methods. That leaves more room for real innovation.\nFuzziness is not accepted today in corporate environments.” John Hagel\nbelieves that Edge thinkers in large organizations should track metrics that\nwill get the attention of the leadership at the core, but at the same time\nidentify and ruthlessly track a new set of metrics relevant to ExOs.\nOne other approach to dashboards in large organizations is the Doblin\nModel. The Doblin Group spent thirty-five years researching innovation and\nrecognized that most senior managers think of innovation largely as product\nfeatures. However, they found there are nine other types of innovation to\ntrack in a balanced way across an organization:\n1. Profit Model: How you make money\n2. Network: How you connect with others to create value\n3. Structure: How you organize and align your talent and assets\n4. Process: How you use signature or superior methods to do y our work\n5.

Thanks to fast iterations with the customer in the loop, however, the\ndevelopment time was halved and the prototype developed for ten times less.\nSocial Technologies\nWhile it may seem as though social technology initiatives have already\nbeen adopted by every company for every product possible, Michael Chui of\nthe McKinsey Global Institute estimates that as much as 80 percent of the\ntrue value of social media may have yet to be captured. Even moredramatically, Jonah Berger of Wharton calculates that “only 7 percent of\nword-of-mouth is online.” Needless to say, their conclusions indicate\nenormous upside potential for properly architected products and services.\nInternally, social technologies focus mainly on collaboration tools such\nas Dropbox, Asana, Box, Google Drive and Evernote. Starting with non-\nmission critical data, internal teams begin with file sharing and then conduct\nlive discussions on their workflow. Remember our GitHub case study in\nChapter Seven? Looked at through the lens of collaboration, a good question\nto ask is: Which advanced social technologies within GitHub can\ncorporations implement in a controlled manner?\nMore on the topic of collaboration: VentureBeat reports that more than\n80 percent of Fortune 500 companies have deployed social software such as\nYammer. However, according to Altimeter Group’s Charlene Li and Brian\nSolis, only 34 percent of 700 executives and social strategists surveyed felt\ntheir social efforts had an effect on business outcomes.\nSimilarly, Computing magazine recently surveyed one hundred senior IT\nprofessionals and found the following:\n68 pe rcent said their organization is using some sort of collaboration.\nJust 12 pe rcent said they had an enterprise-grade collaboration suite.\nOnly 17 percent allow or deliberately ignore the use of consumer\nproducts (e.g., Evernote, Dropbox ).\nChange expert Dion Hinchcliffe of Adjuvi calls the implementation of\nsocial structures via IT departments “a shift in emphasis from systems of\nrecord to systems of engagement,” and has documented several examples of\nlarge organizations seeing outstanding results after deploying collaborative\ntechnologies.",

        "contents": "CEMEX, the Mexican concrete giant, is one such example, and is a\nparticularly inspiring one due to the high average age of its workforce.\nHinchcliffe’s research showed that within a year of introducing collaboration\ntools, fully 95 percent of CEMEX’s employees were using them. Why?\nBecause the pilot program to introduce the tools was designed exclusively\nfor senior management, who typically lag in adopting them. By getting\neveryone enrolled early on, later success was all but guaranteed.\nConclusion\nAs we noted in Chapter Five, when building an ExO it is not realistic to\nexpect to implement all eleven attributes. However, when it comes to big\ncompanies, we believe it is important to take on several—and to take them on\ntoday . Remember, the information comet has already hit, so adaptation to this\nnew world has to happen fast. And the keys to adaptation are MTP, IDEAS\nand SCALE. One reason we’re optimistic about this approach is that it\nsolves the “Big Bet” stigma of betting the farm on an unproven strategy.\nExperimenting at the edges and growing ExOs there allows large companies\nto launch numerous low-cost, high-potential spinoffs that pose no threat to\nWall Street or executive bonuses. It’s one reason that GE, Coca-Cola and\nother large companies are so rapidly embracing Experimentation.\nApple is a good example of how a large company approaches this\nchallenge. Apple’s core competency has always been design, and how it\nlaunches that design follows a set path. In short, Apple’s formula has been to:\n1. Leverage core design capabilities.\n2. Form small teams of changemakers extracted from the larger\norganization.3. Send those teams to the edge of the organization.\n4. Combine design with cutting-edge new technology.\n5. Utterly disrupt a legacy market.\nThat’s not a bad template to follow. Starting with the iPod, which\ndisrupted music players, then iTunes, which fragmented music delivery, then\nthe iPhone, and most recently, the iPad, Apple has demonstrated what an ExO\ncan do at the edge of an existing organization. It has also demonstrated just\nhow big the payoff can be. In 2012, for example, an astounding 80 percent of\nApple’s revenues came from products that were fewer than five years old.\nThose new revenues helped to make Apple the most valuable company in the\nworld.\nAmazon represents another archetype of this philosophy. Jeff Bezos has\nrepeatedly shown the courage to proactively cannibalize his own businesses\n(e.g., the Kindle at the expense of physical book s), launch edge ExOs\n(Amazon Web Services), buy companies that disrupt his own (Zappos ) and\npursue transformative technologies (delivery drones). Such bold leadership\nis critical in the age of the ExO.\nWhile large organizations may struggle to adapt structurally to this new\nage, they still have one key advantage: intellectual capital. Large companies\ndidn’t get big by accident. Most of the world’s global brain trust is running\nthese organizations, and that brain trust has the capacity to come up with\nsome amazing ways to capture or adapt ExO principles. What’s needed is\nvision and will. Or—failing those—fear.\nIn the next chapter, we’ll take an in-depth look at some examples of how\nlarge organizations are adapting to the ExO era.CHAPTER NINE\nBig Companies Adapt\nLet’s now look at how forward-looking companies are implementing the ideas\ndiscussed in the previous chapter. Some are building ExOs at their edges;\nsome are acquiring or investing in ExOs in their current market space; still\nothers are implementing ExO Lite.\nA common saying around Silicon Valley is execution eats strategy for\nbreakfast. So, before we dive in, let’s first look at what can go wrong when a\ncompany leaps into the ExO universe. This isn’t idle speculation. While\nresearching companies whose initiatives were producing positive results, we\nalso found a number that had lost their way. For example, we are convinced\nthat one of Blackberry’s biggest mistakes was that it never had an MTP, while\nBlockbuster’s downfall can be traced to the fact that it never leveraged its\ncommunity (not to mention its considerable hubris when Netflix begged for a\npartnership deal).\nBridgewater – Burning Bridges\nWe also found organizations that, while they didn’t completely fail, did\nattempt some ExO principles—on ly to experience adverse consequences.\nOne such company is the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, which uses\nradical transparency to try to achieve a culture of ultra-honesty, one that is\nfree of negative traits. While there is no question that the firm is phenomenally",

Not only are employees free to question fellow workers,\nthey are also encouraged to attack one another’s ideas.\nBut that’s not all. Employees subject to the greatest number of attacks\nreceive smaller bonuses. As you might imagine, Bridgewater’s practice\ndoesn’t actually result in greater honesty. Instead, it promotes an environment\nof antagonism, betrayal and hidden partnerships. (Word-of-mouth accounts\nsuggest that departing employees take up to a year to recover from\nBridgewater’s intense culture.)\nOur assessment is that Bridgewater is a company without a purpose—that\nis, it has no MTP. And without that greater, unifying purpose, the\naggressiveness that the company instills in its employees ends up misdirected;\nemployees simply turn on one another. Their only aspiration is to be less beat-\nup than their peers, resulting in a Hobbe sian all-against-all scenario that, if\nleft unchanged, will prevent Bridgewater from ever becoming a fulfilling\nplace to work.\nThe following examples show how some big companies are adapting to an\nExO age.\nThe Coca-Cola Company – Exponential PopCoca-Cola, one of the biggest and most geographically distributed\ncorporations in the world, is particularly vulnerable in an age of ExOs, given\nthat the company owns vast assets and has 130,000 e mployees.\nHowever, Coca-Cola didn’t achieve industry eminence and then hold onto\nit for more than a century without being forward thinking and adaptive. In\nkeeping with its tradition of aggressive goal setting, Coca-Cola is currently\nhalfway through an ambitious, exponential target: to double its revenues\nbetween 2010 and 2020. To achieve this goal, the company has taken on\nseveral elements that correlate well with ExO thinking. (Frankly, to hit those\nnumbers, the company doesn’t have much choice.)\nOne of the biggest clues that Coca-Cola has adopted an exponential way\nof thinking is that it has taken on an MTP: “Refresh the World.” A component\nof the company’s new Open Happiness marketing campaign, “Refresh the\nWorld” is certainly Massive, it could be Transformative and it has real\nPurpose. While at first glance the phrase may sound like just another\nmarketing tagline, it has in fact already begun to galvanize the company. For\nexample, after Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013, Coca-Cola\nallocated its entire ad budget for the country to disaster relief. Now that’s\nwalking the walk. The MTP served to clear an internal path at Coca-Cola for\nnon-traditional thinking.\nCoca-Cola also has determined how best to juxtapose itself with the\nstartup community. It realizes that the best ideas most often come from outside\nthe organization and its supply chain, and that the company’s core strengths\nare leveraging assets, creating network effects, planning and executing. As\nDavid Butler, Coke’s vice president of innovation and entrepreneurship, said\nrecently, “That has become our vision—to make it easier for starters to be\nscalers and scalers to be starters.”\nTo deliver on this startup philosophy, Coca-Cola is working with Steve\nBlank and Eric Ries to implement their Lean Startup philosophy across theentire corporation [Experimentation]. Multiple small efforts, each with an\nMVP (Minimum Viable Product) will iterate assumptions and make this\napproach available to anyone in the company via an initiative called Open\nEntrepreneurship. The effects of Experimentation have been immediate:\nButler reports that due to the initiative, Coke’s sustainability goals have\nalready improved by 20 pe rcent.\nCoca-Cola also has become a founding member of Singularity University\nLabs, where disruptive teams can, away from the mother ship [Autonomy,\nLeveraged Assets], work with startups on next-generation products and\nservices. And to further ensure that new ideas can evolve away from existing\nlegacy thinking, Coca-Cola is creating new companies that are completely\nseparate from current cash-cow businesses. These new companies enjoy full\nautonomy from Coke’s existing tax, legal, finance and HR systems [Autonomy,\nDashboards].\nThat said, there is one notable departure for Coca-Cola relative to the\nExO philosophy: the transparency of its disruptive innovation. It is our thesis\nthat disruptive innovation efforts work best when they operate in stealth mode,\ndivorced from the rest of the company, so as to avoid triggering an\norganizational immune system response. Instead, Coca-Cola, taking the long\nview, has created transparent disruption innovation teams with the avowed\ngoal of openly changing the culture of the larger company. The company has\neven publicly taken a strategic stance to integrate disruptive innovations into\nits very core.\nIt is an audacious experiment and we’re watching keenly to see how it\npans out. We believe that if Coke’s core business is infected by the Lean\nStartup meme in time, the company will see the value of this innovation\napproach and become even more open to disruptive innovation efforts at the\nedges.",

Certainly within its\nindustry, Coke is a standout example of a company tackling a disruptive\nfuture.\nOur assessment of Coca-Cola’s Exponential Quotient—62 ou t of 84.\n[Note: all assessments in this chapter were made by the authors\nusing the Exponential Diagnostic Survey found in Appendix A.\nTwenty-one questions are scored from one to four. A score over\n55 indicates an ExO.]\nHaier – Higher and Higher\nOne of the biggest concerns we hear about from companies implementing\nExO thinking is that “It might work in Silicon Valley, but it just won’t work in\nLondon, or Budapest or Milan.”\nIn his book  The New Geography  of Jobs, Enrico Moretti argues just that:\nwhere a company is based does indeed matter. For example, if you’re trying\nto build a global company in Italy, your primarily Italian speakers at company\nheadquarters won’t have a global perspective. Thus, it’s no accident that most\nof the ExOs we’ve found are based in Silicon Valley, or at least in English-\nspeaking countries. That said, in our research we did find several largeenterprises in non-English-speaking locales that are successfully\nimplementing ExO principles.\nPerhaps the most remarkable of these is Haier, a Chinese appliance maker\n(formerly known as Qingdao Refrigerator Company), which has 80,000\nemployees and which recorded $30 bi llion in sales for 2013 a lone.\nBill Fischer, co-author with Umberto Lago and Fang Liu of the book\nReinventing Giants: How Chinese Global Competitor Haier Has Change d\nthe Way Big Companies Transform, makes the important observation that the\n“business model and corporate culture are inextricably linked.” The authors\ntracked Haier for over a decade, along the way identifying four key stages that\nlarge organizations must navigate to reinvent their cultures:\nBuild quality\nDiversify\nRe-engineer the business process\nReduce distance to customer\nZhan Ruimin, a former Haier administrator who was appointed CEO by\nthe Chinese state in 1984, implemented the quality-building step early on in\nhis tenure. A famous anecdote has him handing out sledgehammers and joining\nstaffers in destroying a few dozen subpar refrigerators. His next move was to\ndiversify into other home appliances. In 2005, Zhan decided to shred Haier’s\nentire middle management layer and reorganize the company’s 80,000\nemployees into 2,000 ZZJYTs, a Chinese acronym for independent, self-\nmanaged units, each having a P&L, where team members are paid on\nperformance [Autonomy]. These units have several fascinating\ncharacteristics:\nEmployees are able to switch between units.Each unit has a P&L, and team members share profits, have their own\nperformance-based incentives and are paid on performance.\nCustomer-facing employees are given maximum flexibility and full\ndecision-making capabilities.\nInstead of following set orders from the company, a team’s primary\nresponsibility is to increase customer demand.\nAnyone can propos e new products, which are then voted on not just by\nemployees, but also suppliers and customers, who collectively\ndetermine which projects are funded [Experimentation, Community &\nCrowd].\nWhoever propos es a winning idea becomes a unit leader, empowered to\nrecruit team members from across the organization.\nEvery quarter, each team has the oppor tunity to vote its unit leader out\n[Autonomy].\nPerformance is tracked on a daily, real-time basis [Dashboards].\nHaier’s community management system, known as HOPE (Haier Open\nPartnership Ecosystem), is an open innovation ecosystem across which\n670,000 users communicate with suppliers and other customers\nsearching for new business opportunities [Engagement]. Anyone can\ncontribute ideas or compete in contests [Engagement: incentive\ncompetitions].\nHaier launched a global Green Home Vision contest and a global slogan\ncontest on Facebook . In its first year, four winners (out of 200,000\nslogan entries) won a trip to China. [Community & Crowd, Engagement].\nHaier has been named the most valuable brand in China for the past\nthirteen years. Both Fast Company  magazine and the Boston Consulting\nGroup recently labeled it one of the most innovative companies in the world.\nIn fact, despite being overseen by the Chinese government, Haier is amazingly\ninnovative.

From 2011 to 2014, the market cap of Haier tripled from\n$20 billion to $60 billion, largely due to its implementation of Autonomy and\nExperimentation. Not surprisingly, the company gets high scores as an ExO.\nHaier’s Exponential Quotient—68 ou t of 84.\nXiaomi – Showing You and Me\nIt’s hard to fully capture the incredible ascent of Xiaomi Tech, another\nChinese company. Founded in June 2010 and focused on low-end Android\nsmartphones, the company sold twenty million handsets in 2013, recording\nannual revenues of more than $5 bi llion.\nLei Jun, one of the founders, is seen as a Chinese Steve Jobs. That’s not\njust because he’s been heavily inspired by Apple’s design, marketing and\nsupply chain management, but also because of Xiaomi’s intense focus on\nperformance, quality and customer experience—characteristics that Lei Jun\nwants to make available to everyone at affordable prices.\nXiaomi offers a curated Apple smartphone experience with the software\ndevelopment, speed and processes of Google Android, all at a low price. The\ncompany currently outsells Apple in China and is closing in on Samsung. Itsproducts are available in four Asian countries and the company plans to\nexpand to ten more emerging markets, including India and Brazil. Needless to\nsay, Xiaomi features a full complement of ExO characteristics.\nXiaomi has an extremely flat structure consisting of core founders,\ndepartment leaders and about 4,300 employees, a system that enables short-\nline communication and decision-making in a fast-paced organization\n[Autonomy]. Some 3,000 e mployees, including 1,500 pe ople working at a call\ncenter, perform e-commerce, logistics and after-sales. The rest of the\nworkforce (1,300 employees) works in R&D, which, at 30 percent of the\nworkforce, is significant.\nThe culture of the individual teams is that of a traditional clan or tribe—\nfamily-like and focused on mentoring, collaboration and adhocracy\n[Autonomy, Experimentation]. Dynamic and entrepreneurial, with a focus on\nrisk taking, Xiaomi only hires people who are passionate about their work\nand who are experts in their respective fields. Job incentives are available in\nthe form of profit sharing and job rotation, which means employees are free to\nswitch jobs at any moment.\nA big difference relative to Apple is how extensively Xiaomi leverages\nits ecosystem [Community & Crowd]. Lei is convinced that customers are the\ncompany’s best source in terms of product design and services. As a result,\nXiaomi employees are required to spend at least thirty minutes a day\ninteracting with customers on user forums and social networks. Xiaomi also\nholds special events for its community of almost ten million fans, and stages\nelaborate product launches, much as Google and Apple do.\nXiaomi’s most loyal followers are called “Mi fen” ( 米粉  in Chinese),\nwhich in addition to translating as “Xiaomi fan” also means “rice flour,” a\nplay on Xiaomi’s name, which means millet or “little rice.” During its 2014\nMi Fen Festival, fans bought $242 million worth of products in just twelve\nhours. Xiaomi came up with a game for the festival called Kings of Knockout,in which users could win discount coupons [Engagement]. The game was\nheavily promoted on the Chinese social network site Weibo, as well as on\nTwitter, Facebook  and Google+. Recently appointed global vice president\nHugo Barra, ex-VP of Google Android, thinks that this type of informal and\nplayful engagement is the biggest reason for Xiaomi fans’ loyalty to the brand.\nAs Lei predicted, the community also helps with product development. Of\nthe twenty-five languages currently available on its OS, Xiaomi developed\njust three; the rest were created by users [Community & Crowd]. This user\ncommunity of almost ten million helps the company not only with products but\nalso with support. Xiaomi has a fully peer-to-peer customer service platform\nthat is driven and organized by the users themselves. On top of that, the\ncompany’s marketing costs are relatively low, since Xiaomi sells its products\ndirectly online, using no resellers. In fact, all marketing is done via social\nmedia, with consumers spreading the word virally, at no cost to the company.\nAlthough it was initially very difficult for Xiaomi to find manufacturing\npartners for its smartphones, the company now uses Foxconn and other\npartners for its product lines [Leveraged Assets]. Xiaomi also discloses the\nnames and parts numbers of all its suppliers, which helps protect those\nsuppliers from the many counterfeit devices flooding the Chinese market.\nImagine selling twenty million smartphones in just three years—from a\nstanding start. Xiaomi, which has done just that, embodies ten of the eleven\nExO attributes.\nXiaomi’s Exponential Quotient—74 ou t of 84.\n",

Similarly, in 2009, when the UK government bowed to\npublic pressure and released two million pages of parliamentary expense\nreports, the Guardian asked its readership to find any newsworthy needles in\nthat vast haystack of words. In response, its readers analyzed more than 20\npercent of the total volume in just over three days.\nWe believe that journalism will increasingly follow the Guardian’s lead\nand shift to an ExO model, much like Medium’s efforts to become a platform.\nAnd that is good news, because a free and healthy press (with investigative\njournalism being the tip of that spear) is critical both for democracy and in\nguarding fundamental individual freedoms.\nThe Guardian’s Exponential Quotient—62 ou t of 84.\nGeneral Electric – General Excellence\nIt is no accident that GE is one of the most admired companies in the\nworld. Over the decades, the company has repeatedly and successfullyreinvented itself—something it seems to be doing once again by aggressively\npartnering with ExO companies.\nWe have referenced Quirky several times throughout this book  and will\nnow focus on its MTP, which is “Make Invention Accessible.” General\nElectric early on saw the huge potential of the new crowdsourced model of\nproduct development. It subsequently partnered with Quirky in 2012 on\nincentive competition [Engagement], whereby the Quirky community was\ntasked with dreaming up innovative everyday products. The submissions\nwould then be put to a community vote, with the winning invention\nmanufactured by GE.\nOut of a total of 1,500 submissions, the Quirky community selected the\nMilkmaid, a smart container that alerts users when milk begins to spoil or run\nlow, as the top product. Each subsequent phase of the Milkmaid’s production,\nincluding product design, name, tagline and even price, was crowdsourced as\nwell [Crowd], resulting in a total of 2,530 contributions from the Quirky\ncommunity for a single product.\nAlthough the Milkmaid was just a pilot [Experimentation], the project was\ndeemed a huge success, and in 2013, GE and Quirky announced the next stage\nof their innovative new partnership: GE gave Quirky’s 900,000 community\nmembers open access to GE’s most promising patents and technologies. It\nalso started a co-branded Internet of Things initiative called “Wink: Instantly\nConnected,” dedicated to building a line of smart home devices.\nGE, which invested $30 million in Quirky, chose to open up its patents in\norder to accelerate the creation of new, innovative products—something GE\ndetermined the crowd could accomplish more quickly than it could do on its\nown. That decision is clearly paying off. In addition to the four connected-\nhome products currently available in Quirky’s online store, GE and Quirky\nexpect to release more than 30 m ore such products over the next few years.At about the time GE announced its partnership with Quirky, the company\nalso opened a new makerspace in Chicago called GE Garages, which is\npowered by TechShop and works in partnership with Skillshare, Quirky,\nMake and Inventables [Leveraged Assets, Staff on Demand]. As with the\nQuirky relationship outlined above, GE began with a pilot program in 2012,\nlaunching GE Garages as mobile pop-ups traveling around the United States.\nA year later it opened its Chicago makerspace, where contributors have full\naccess to manufacturing tools such as CNC mills, laser cutters, 3D printers\nand molders. GE also provides workshops and demos.\nIn February 2014, GE extended its ExO initiatives even further by\nannouncing a partnership with Local Motors to launch a new model for\nmanufacturing called First Build. This partnership will source collaborative\nideas from an online community of engineers, scientists, fabricators, designers\nand enthusiasts who will focus on identifying market needs and solving deep\nengineering challenges in the hopes of unlocking breakthrough product\ninnovations. The most popu lar of these innovations will then be built, tested\nand sold in a specialized “microfactory.” This facility will focus on testing,\nrapid prototyping and small-volume production.\nIn conjunction with Alaska Airlines, GE provides yet another example of\nusing ExO partnerships to leverage Engagement. In November 2013, the two\ncompanies partnered with Kaggle to create Flight Quest, an incentive\ncompetition in which contestants were challenged to create algorithms that\ncould predict airplane arrival times more precisely. Each reduced-minute per\nflight can save $1.2 million in crew costs and $5 million in annual fuel\nsavings. GE provided contestants with two weeks of FlightStats data. Out of\n173 entries, five winners were awarded a total of $250,000. The winning\nalgorithm proved 40 percent better at predicting arrival times than current\ntechnologies.",

By comparison, if just one of fifty investors likes a\nstartup, it’s off to the races.\nAlong with the many ExO attributes Amazon has implemented, the\ncompany has also addressed the ease with which anyone in a big company can\nsay no. One of the more intriguing organizational innovations to come out of\nthe company is what CEO Jeff Bezos and CTO Werner Vogels call “The\nInstitutional Yes.”\nHere’s how it works: If you’re a manager at Amazon and a subordinate\ncomes to you with a great idea, your default answer must be YES. If you want\nto say no, you are required to write a two-page thesis explaining why it’s a\nbad idea. In other words, Amazon has increased the friction entailed in saying\nno, resulting in more ideas being tested (and hence implemented) throughout\nthe company.Jeff Bezos is perhaps the most underrated CEO of the last couple decades.\nNot only has he made that rare transition from founder to large-company CEO,\nbut he has also consistently avoided the short-term thinking that so often\ncomes with running a public company—what Joi Ito calls “nowism.” Amazon\nregularly makes long bets (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Kindle, and now Fire\nsmartphones and delivery drones), views new products as if they are\nseedlings needing careful tending for a five-to-seven-year period, is maniacal\nabout growth over profits and ignores the short-term view of Wall Street\nanalysts. Its pioneering initiatives include its Affiliate Program, its\nrecommendation engine (collaborative filtering) and the Mechanical Turk\nproject.

        "contents": "Zappos – Zapping Boredom\nIt took just eight years for Zappos, which got its start selling shoes online\nin 1999 , to hit $1 billion in annual sales. In 2007 Zappos  expanded its\nbusiness to clothing and accessories, which now account for 20 percent of its\nannual revenue.\nWe’ve already seen some of the ways Zappos  uses ExO attributes: an\nemphasis on customer service [MTP: “Provide the Best Customer Service\nPossible”]; its creation of a community around common passions and a\ncommon location in the Las Vegas Downtown Project, and its managed\ncommunities through Like-Like relationships [Community]; and its use of the\nFace Game to improve internal culture [Engagement: gamification].\nTo that list add the fact that Zappos employees answer 5,000 calls a month\nand 1,200 emails a week (and even more during the holiday season, when\ncall-frequency increases significantly). Call center employees don’t have\nscripts and there are no limits on call times; in fact, the longest Zappos  call\nreported is ten hours and twenty-nine minutes [Autonomy, Dashboards].\n50 percent of a new recruit’s probationary review is based on his or her\ncultural fit with the company. Each recruit spends four weeks shadowing\nexperienced employees [MTP], and at the end of that period is offered $3,000\nto leave the company—further weeding out cultural misfits.\nInstead of performance reviews, Zappos  managers conduct cultural\nassessments [Dashboards]. They evaluate employees based on their fit within\nthe company culture and offer suggestions on how to improve that fit. To be\neligible for raises, employees must pass skill-based tests. Zappos  also\nregularly holds internal incentive competitions and hackathons, most relating\nto company data and APIs. In 2011 Zappos  opened its competitions to the\nexternal developer community as well (the API Developer Challenge and theWinter Hackathon), and awarded money and gift certificates to the winners\n[Engagement].\nIn December 2013, CEO Tony Hsieh adopted the Holacracy approach and\nshook up the 1,500- person organization by moving to full Autonomy. After six\nmonths, 225 e mployees had been transitioned from the old hierarchical model,\nand Zappos  is currently stripping all job titles and management layers—\neventually, even the CEO job will disappear. This is an extraordinary move\nfor a large firm, perhaps the largest such transition ever attempted.\nA key question that often comes up with Zappos  is, “How does it hire\nwithout job descriptions?” In 2014, despite the fact that Zappos planned to\nexpand its workforce by a third, from 1,500 employees to almost 2,000, no\njob postings went up anywhere. In order to apply, candidates were required to\njoin a social network called Zappos  Insiders. By continually monitoring the\nactivity of candidates and how they interfaced with existing employees,\nZappos  recruiters maintained an always-on pool of candidates. Zappos  also\nused Ascendify, an online platform that runs Q&A sessions and incentive\ncompetitions, to filter for skills and cultural fit. With the success of this hiring\nprocess, Zappos  may very well revolutionize the corporate HR function. For\nall these reasons, Zappos  gets a high score on our ExO diagnostic.\nZappos  Exponential Quotient— 75 ou t of 84.\n",

        "contents": "ING Direct Canada (now Tangerine) – BankING\nAutonomy\nAnother major concern often expressed about implementing ExO\nprinciples is, “Well, it might work in Silicon Valley or for a cute gaming\ncompany, but it won’t work in a real operational environment.”\nEnter ING Direct Canada, a bank with fiduciary obligations and\nregulatory requirements—in notoriously regulatory Canada, no less.\nOriginally part of ING Group, headquartered in the Netherlands, ING Direct\nCanada was founded in April 1997 by Arkadi Kuhlmann. It was the first test\nmarket for ING Group’s direct banking business model, which provided more\nfavorable rates to customers by removing brick and mortar branches\naltogether.\nKuhlmann started ING Direct Canada with the MTP “Save Your Money,”\nand added three key complementary values: Simplify, Be challengers, Be the\ngood g uy.\nKuhlmann took the concept of Autonomy to its full extent by completely\nflattening the organization and getting rid of all job titles, seniority levels,\nmanagement layers, formal meetings and even offices. Employees worked\ntogether and identified themselves by their responsibilities.\nIn 2008, Peter Aceto became CEO of ING Direct Canada and continued\nwhat Arkadi had started. In fact, after a year in the role, he took a page from\nPhilip Rosedale’s book  and had his employees vote on whether or not he\nshould stay on as CEO. Aceto also has no office, and to this day continues to\nshare as much information as possible internally about the performance of the\ncompany. In doing so, he has stimulated a culture of trust, sharing,\ntransparency and vulnerability. Named Toronto’s Communicator of the Year in\n2010, Aceto is known as “the social media CEO” and even responds to\ncustomer queries on weekends.ING Direct set up four “cafés” (a term ING prefers to branches) across\nCanada. These locations served as touch points for customers to enjoy face-\nto-face interaction with bank representatives, or to simply grab a cup of\ncoffee. Kuhlmann’s primary purpose with the cafés was to reassure customers\nand build the brand. Increasingly, however, ING cafés have become places to\nhang out and talk to other people about money. Local community groups even\norganize Tweetups.\nIn 2010, ING invited 10,000 Canadians to be part of a beta group to test\nTHRiVE, a new free checking account service. Their feedback helped\nimprove the service prior to launch, and in 2011, THRiVE was named\nFinancial Product of the Year by global market researcher TNS Global.\nScotiabank acquired ING Direct Canada in August 2012. Now known as\nTangerine, it remains a stand-alone business, with Aceto still at the helm.\nTangerine staff still operate with considerable Autonomy. If an advertising\npromotion proves successful, employees operate on a beehive philosophy and\nthose with customer service experience swarm to the phone banks. At\nregulatory reporting time, those same employees might cluster around\nfulfilling that requirement. A combination of real accountability (the\ncompany’s chief risk officer has regulatory accountability) and a flexible\nwork staff gives the organization the best of both worlds.\nHow well has it worked? While an average Canadian bank has about 250\ncustomers per employee, Tangerine handles 1,800 per employee—a 7x\nimprovement. On average, Canadian banks manage about $10,000 in deposits\nper employee; Tangerine handles $40,000 pe r employee—a 4x improvement.\nTangerine’s Exponential Quotient—69 ou t of 84.",

        "name": "Google Ventures – The Almost Perfect EExO",
        "contents": "Google Ventures – The Almost Perfect EExO\nIn March 2009, Bill Maris launched Google Ventures, Google’s own\ncorporate venture capital fund, with a $100 million capital commitment. Now,\nafter five years, the company has emerged as one of the most active and\nsuccessful VCs, with sixty employees (all partners) and $1.5 billion under\nmanagement. Now that is an ExO move, one that represents a 15x increase\nover five years.\nGoogle Ventures already has completed more than twenty successful exits,\nwith returns far exceeding market averages for venture capital funds. Indeed,\nits emergence as one of the top financiers of startups may be a first for a\ncorporate venture fund. While tech companies have long backed startups, their\nventure arms have a history of terribly subpar returns, mainly because there\nwas no real independence from the parent company.\nGoogle Ventures has invested in more than 225 portfolio companies\nencompassing all stages and industry sectors, including such rising stars as\nUber, Nest, 23andMe, Cloudera, Optimizely, TuneIn, Homejoy and High\nFidelity. As a result of its many successes, Google Ventures opened a London\noffice in 2014, w ith $100 m illion to invest in European startups.\nAlthough Google provides the funds for Google Ventures, invested\ncompanies don’t have to benefit Google. That means portfolio companies stay\nindependent and can be acquired by competitors. A downside of this\nstructure, of course, is that Google Ventures might well remain in the darkabout potential deals being undertaken by its parent company. In fact, this is\nwhat happened when Google acquired Nest, creator of smart thermostats and\nsmoke alarms, for $3.2 billion in January 2014. Nonetheless, although the\npossibility of such an outcome is a show-stoppe r for many large\norganizations, we believe the benefits of independence far outweigh the\noccasional costs.\nGoogle Ventures contributes more than money. In addition to providing\ndesign services (10x faster than traditional design agencies), it hosts\nworkshops where founders and employees of portfolio companies hone their\nproduct management or operational skills. The company also helps with\nmarketing, recruiting, and engineering, often tapping Google’s vast resources\nto do s o.\nA key differentiator for Google Ventures is its use of data analytics and\nalgorithms to assess deals. The company employs seven data scientists who\ncollect and analyze as much data as possible before deciding where to invest.\nAs Maris said, “We have access to the world’s largest datasets you can\nimagine. Our cloud computer infrastructure is the biggest ever. It would be\nfoolish to just go out and make gut investments.” Other firms, such as Sequoia\nCapital and Y Combinator, are taking note and adapting quickly.\nIt’s important to note that the data informs but does not decide. Like most\nVCs, Google Ventures invests in people over products. If the data shows a\npotentially great company but the founding team doesn’t feel right about some\naspect of it, no investment will be made. The fund uses OKRs extensively to\ntrack the progress of its portfolio companies and relies heavily on real-time\nmetrics—everything is quantified. The portfolio companies are initiated into\nthis way of thinking via GV’s Startup Lab, a private program that is part\nincubator, part hackathon and part co-working space.\nTo find potential companies, Google Ventures leverages Google’s 50,000\nemployees. Employees are encouraged to refer stealth startups or founders; ifan investment is ultimately made, the employee gets a $10,000 finders fee. In\naddition, portfolio companies not only have full access to GV’s partners, they\nalso have the option of connecting with specific Google employees. In fact,\nthis is one of the biggest perks Google Ventures offers: unique access to some\nof the best engineers, scientists and technology in the world. A community\nportal connects the GV team with Google employees and peers from other\nportfolio companies. Hiring for the portfolio companies is also facilitated by\nGoogle Ventures’ ability to tap Google’s extensive database of resumes,\nwhich number over a million a year.\nLike any worthy ExO, Google Ventures is even willing to disrupt itself. In\n2014 it led a $28 million financing round in AngelList, a Craigslist-like\nmarketplace that matches entrepreneurs and angel investors. AngelList\nintroduced a new funding model called syndicates, in which lesser-known\nangels pool their dollars with those of investors with established track\nrecords. The model essentially allows better-known investors to build mini-\nfunds for specific deals. Remarkably, this puts those investors in direct\ncompetition with Google Ventures, especially over seed-stage deals, which\naccount for about half of its investments. Nonetheless, Google Ventures is\nwilling to accept the possibility of competition, putting the company firmly on\nthe disruption side of Clayton Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma.\nGoogle Ventures boasts ten ExO attributes out of eleven (and the eleventh,\nthe MTP, is inherited from its parent).\nGoogle Ventures’ Exponential Quotient—76 ou t of 84.\n",

        "name": "Growing with the Crowd",
        "contents": "Growing with the Crowd\nIn December 2013, Jeremiah Owyang, a social media strategist, launched\nan industry group called Crowd Companies. According to Owyang, Crowd\nCompanies is a “brand council” whose activities include introductions,\neducational forums and networking with relevant startups, many of which are\nExOs. Several dozen major brands have already joined the group, and\nOwyang believes that as this new breed of companies leveraging crowd\ndynamics spreads out across the world, they will in turn spark what he calls a\nCollaborative Economy (outlined below). Owyang has identified seventy-five\ncrowd-based startups operating in six vertical markets. Lisa Gansky’s Mesh\nLabs takes this model to a much more granular level, listing nine thousand\ncrowd-based startups in twenty-five categories.\nSuch adoption of social media is not a fad. In fact, the social business\nmovement (tagged #socbiz on Twitter) represents a foundational step towards\na future landscape filled with ExOs. Currently, one hundred twenty business\nleaders and thirty-four Fortune 500 companies are council members of Crowd\nCompanies and, according to Owyang, over eighty global brands have\nexperimented with these techniques.Owyang isn’t alone in his thinking: Shel Israel, co-author of the book  Age\nof Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy, noted recently\nthat there have been many such labels attached to this new movement: the\nSharing Economy, the Mesh Economy, Collaborative Consumption and the\nCollaborative Economy.\nWe actually think Exponential Organizations works quite well as a label.\nBut whatever the ultimate designation, it is clear that ExO attributes can and\nare being implemented by large organizations. In fact, as we wrote this book\nwe were surprised to see how fast that implementation is occurring. What was\nlittle more than a loose theory when we sat down to outline the book  has now\ntaken on the trappings of a global movement. Large organizations everywhere\nare realizing that to remain competitive they must address their historic biases\nand impose a new reality, one that willingly jettisons anachronistic business\npractices—no matter how effective they were in the past—in favor of new\nones that are better equipped for an ever-faster-moving world.Over the last four years, Juan Manuel Rowland of Azteca (Mexico), the\nlargest Latin TV studio, has been transforming Azteca’s approach to digital\ncontent. Initially a consultant responsible for migrating all Azteca novellas\nand programs to digital video streams, Rowland was tapped by Azteca CEO\nMario San Román to join the company and do something bold. Rowland\nnoticed that although streaming existing programs yielded little revenue for the\ncompany, Latin YouTube stars were getting millions of views for their videos.\nMoving to the edge as requested, he acquired a big house and installed a\ndozen young YouTube enthusiasts, all tasked with producing videos under a\nnew brand called ContenTV. Reveling in the off-brand culture and the\noppor tunity to live and work in a creative, take-no-prisoners space, the kids\nthrived. Within a year, ContenTV videos were getting more than ten times the\nviews than those of Azteca (again, talk about an ExO!). In the second year,\nRowland and his team developed a business model and put a sales team on it.\nAfter some growing pains and tensions with the flagship brand, ContenTV\nwas reabsorbed into Azteca, but it remains a stand-alone property. Having\nlearned from their experience, Rowland and San Román are reapplying their\noriginal vision to a new model.\nWho drives the decision to become an Exponential Organization? We can\nsee from the Azteca example that it is the senior manage rs, the men and\nwomen at the C-Level such as San Román, upon whom the fate of the\nenterprise ultimately rests. They will soon be experiencing tremendous\npressure to adapt, just as they will ultimately be responsible for the results. It\nis to this group, then, that we turn in our final chapter.CHAPTER TEN\nThe Exponential Executive\nThe ExO concept—the new organizing principle for the information age—is\njust a few years old and thus still evolving into its final form. By necessity\nthen, this book  has been very much a series of messages from the front lines\nof business competition.\nAs we noted at the beginning of the book , this is not the first time such a\nrevolution has taken place. Indeed, business transformations have arrived\nlike clockwork almost every decade for the last century, each time driven by\nthe appearance of some new and important enabling technology. Thus, the\n“virtual” economy we live and work in today was made possible twenty\nyears ago by the rise of the Internet and, more recently, by the impact of\nmobile technologies. Here is an example of how one company’s senior\nmanagement is facing that future:\nCase Study: Expon ential Innovation Within Citigroup\nInterest Rates is one of the major market-facing divisions\nof Citigroup’s investment bank . With hundr eds of employees\nglobally, more than fifty separate sub-businesses and billions\nof dollars in yearly revenue, it is a large organization by any\nmeasure—and not the sort normally associated with disruptive\ninnov ation.",

        "contents": "The company  was staffed with a lot of very smart people\ndrowning unde r a deluge of data—price movements, econom ic\nreleases, client data and news—far more data than any human\ncould reasonabl y consume and analyze. Andy Morton, the\ndivision’s global head and a self-described “numbers guy”\n(famous in the financ ial world as one of the three creators of\nthe Heath-Jarrow-Morton interest rate framework), had long\nbelieved that a new generation of smart algorithms could\nexpone ntially improve the produc tivity of his organization. In\n2014, he hired Arjun Viswanathan, an interest rate option\ntrader with twelve years of experience using computational\nmarket techniques, to help him realize this vision.\nViswanathan’s task was to find a way to embrace and use data\neffectively.\nViswanathan (like Morton, a mathematician/computer-\nscientist-turned-trader), had been exposed to the concept of\nExpone ntial Organizations at the 2013 Singularity Summit in\nBudape st, and wanted to implement ExO ideas internally. He\nand Morton carefully designed their experiment: Viswanathan\nwould report directly to Morton and would have access to all\nRates’ resources and data. He also had a mandat e to form\nfluid teams with other senior people within the business.\nResources would be used on demand, while applications would\nbe tested and iterated rapidly via an internal group of\nemployees. Apps would be small, intuitive, fun and visual—in\nshort, they would be designed to get information into\nemployees’ minds as quickly as possible. AI, Machine\nLearning and data analytics would be extensively used to freeup human thinking. The idea was to put the right people,\nresources and ideas together and wait for something magical\nto happe n.\nSomething did. Within just three months, the new setup\nresulted in several key problems being solved, including\npredictions concerning client behavior, market moves and\npending econom ic releases, as well as market regime\nclassification. There were also several other chunk y problems\nthat, in the old world, would have taken multi-person teams a\nyear or more to implement.\nAll issues on the table, however, were solved within weeks,\nusing one-twentieth the resources, time and cost as before—an\noutcome that would have seemed impossible as recently as\n2012. Real applications now sit on key desks, answering in\nseconds  questions that previously took days to answer—or\nsimply could not be answered at all. The apps  themselves were\nbeautiful, and e mployees were enjoying us ing them in ways not\noriginally imagined; data was once again fun. Today , this\nparadigm is catching on elsewhere within Citigroup, with\nother divisions investigating how they can kick-start similar\nchange  within their own ope rations.\nWhy did the new setup work so well for the Rates group?\nSuccess grew out of a strong c ombination of  the following:\nSuppor t for the project at the highest level. Morton is an\nintellectually curious business head willing to disrupt his\norganization.\nReliance on a coordinator with both domain and machine\nlearning expertise.A well-conne cted network of people within the business\nwho actively embrace algorithmic augm entation of\nhuman roles and ar e quick to exchange  ideas.\nAn unde rstanding and i mplementation of  ExO techniques.\nLife at C-Level\nToday, a new wave of revolutionary technologies have begun to make\ntheir mark: cheap analog sensors, Bitcoin, 3D printing, neuro-marketing, AI,\nrobotics, nanotech and Big Data. And these technologies are just the\nvanguard of an era of unprecedented innovation. Not only can they change the\nway businesses organize and operate, they must do so. Merely adopting any\nof these new technologies will force fundamental changes in how we work.\nIn particular, by their very nature, these technologies will accelerate the pace\nof the commercial world—a nd not just incrementally, but expone ntially. And\nfor all that we’ve been through over the last half-century of the technology\nrevolution, this acceleration will be unlike anything we’ve ever known\nbefore.\nIn time, we are all going to experience this astonishing new pace of\nchange…bu t no one sooner, or ultimately more, than corporate executives.\nThese so-called C-Level executives, including the CEO, CMO, CTO, CFO\netc., and the newly-emerging Chief Data Officer (CDO), are going to find\nthemselves under enormous pressure to either “go exponential”—as we’ve\nalready seen, a difficult task for any established enterprise—or deal with the\nthreat presented by new, exponential competitors. The decisions they will\nmake, often under pressure and on the fly, will likely determine not just\nwhether their companies succeed, but whether or not they survive. Onceagain, this isn’t the first time corporate executives have faced an existential\nchallenge wrought by a technological/organizational revolution, but this time\naround the window of oppor tunity will be briefer than ever before. There\nwill be no time to hesitate—much less time to ponder—be fore making major\nstrategic moves.\nFor that reason, we are dedicating this final chapter to understanding the\nExponential Executive, a new leader destined to emerge from this\ntransformed economy. And by the end of the chapter, we hope to have\nanswered the following:\nWhich technologies will have the most impact on the C-Suite?\nWhat new organizational developments must an Exponential Executive\ntrack and be ready for?\nWhat questions and issues will the ExO Executive face in the next five\nto ten years as a result of this collective and accelerating change?\nWe begin by touching on a sample of five major technologies and some\nmeta-trends that will drive change across many industries. Then we’ll\nexamine how the CEO, CMO, CTO and other executives need to deal with\nthese technologies in the very near future.\nLet’s begin with the transformative technologies (with many thanks to the\nfaculty at Singularity University, who suggested or reviewed many of the\nideas below):\nLikely Breakthrough Technologies\nSensors and the Internet of Things\nDescription: We’ll see a leap from eight billion Internet-\nconnected devices today to fifty billion by 2020.Anything and everything will have sensors embedded,\nfrom wearables and packages to even food.\nImplications: Infinite computation (as Moore’s Law\ncontinues) and infinite storage, both essentially free; the\nQuantified Employee; AaaS (Analytics as a Service);\nhardware as the new software via developments such as\nArduino; new business models based on connected\nproducts.\nAI, data science and analytics\nDescription: Ubiquitous usage of Machine Learning and\nDeep Learning algorithms to process vast caches of\ninformation.\nImplications: Algorithms driving more and more business\ndecisions; AIs replacing a large percentage of\nknowledge workers; AIs looking for patterns in\norganizational data; algorithms embedded into products.\nVirtual/augmented reality\nDescription: Avatar-quality VR available on desktop in 2-3\nyears. Oculus Rift, High Fidelity and Google Glass drive\nnew applications.\nImplications: Remote viewing; centrally located experts\nserving more areas; new practice areas; remote\nmedicine.\nBitcoin and block chain\nDescription: Trustless, ultra-low-cost secure transactions\nenabled by distributed ledgers that log everything.Implications: The blockchain becomes a trust engine; most\nthird-party validation functions become automated (e.g.,\nmulti-signatory contracts, voting systems, audit\npractices). Micro-transactions and new payment systems\nbecome ubiquitous.\nNeuro-feedbac k\nDescription: Use of feedback loops  to bring the brain to a\nhigh level of precision.\nImplications: Capacity to test and deploy entirely new\nclasses of applications (e.g., focus@will); group\ncreativity apps; flow hacking; therapeutic aids, stress\nreduction and sleep improvement.\nThese new technologies will, in turn, underpin the appearance of five\nlikely meta-trends:\nPerfect knowledge\nImplications: With the Internet of (Every)thing, sensors,\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems and unlimited\nsensors, users will be able to know anything they want,\nanywhere and at any time.\nVirtual worlds\nImplications: Philip Rosedale notes that Hollywood\nspecial effects migrate to the desktop after five years.\nAvatar is now three years old and will soon be available\non the Oculus Rift. Almost perfect VR is around the\ncorner, and will deliver experiential reality andtransform retail, travel, and living and working\nenvironments.\n3D printing\nImplications: 3D printing (and soon 4D) will not radically\nchange big manufacturing, but it will enable an entirely\nnew class of products that will displace traditional\nmanufacturing. A Kinko’s model of local 3D printing of\nvirtually anything will appear shortly and the technology\nwill have a major impact on warehousing and\ntransportation. U.S. manufacturing will be revitalized as\nrecent offshoring trends reverse.\nDisruption of payment systems\nImplications: In 2012, Visa and MasterCard credit card\npurchases totaled more than $1.5 trillion in the U.S.\nalone. Payment systems and money transfer mechanisms\nhaven’t changed for decades, but with Square, PayPal\nand now Clinkle and Bitcoin, this domain is ready for a\nmajor transformation. One form will come via\nmobile/social wallets and seamless transactions. A\nsecond will come via micropayments (probably via the\nblock chain). The ability to move infinitesimal\ntransaction amounts will underpin entirely new business\nmodels.\nAutonomous vehicles\nImplications: In September 2014, California will issue the\nfirst license plates for driverless cars. Starting withdelivery vehicles and then taxis, predictions call for\nexisting road capacity to increase 8-10 times once a\ncritical mass of AVs is reached. Ridesharing is an\nintermediate step toward fully automated transportation,\nwhich may have a bigger visible impact on society than\nanything else, including sustainability, urban planning\n(almost no parking lots) and fewer traffic fatalities.\nNote that most of these technologies and trends were unknown a decade\nago, and all were non-existent thirty years ago. No doubt even more\ntechnologies and trends, as yet unknown, will emerge in even the next five\nyears as convergences and intersection points drive an ever-faster pace of\nchange. For five decades, predictions around Moore’s Law have promised\nacceleration, and we are now seeing what that really means.\nIt is important to stress that the two lists above  represent just a small\nsample of what is racing our way. It’s also worth revisiting the findings of the\nInnovation Partners Program survey, detailed in Chapter Eight, of the eighty\nFortune 500 C -Level executives:\nBefore the event, 75 percent of the C-Level attendees had little or no\nawareness of accelerating technologies.\nAfter the program, 80 percent of the attendees agreed that the\ntechnologies and strategies would have a “game-changing impact” on\ntheir industries within two years, and all agreed that the impact would\noccur within five years.\nAll of the executives—100 percent of them—had a list of urgent-action\nitems upon returning to their offices.\nNote that second statistic. 80 percent of Fortune 500 CxOs agreed that\ntheir industries would experience game-changing transformations due to",

We are also entering an age\nin which HR will be critical in effectively managing not only core FTEs, but\nalso the larger Staff on Demand (as well as crowdsourced inputs), which\nwill now operate on a global scale. Managing the ExO attributes Interfaces\nand Staff on Demand will be key new requirements for the HR function.\nThe World’s Most Important Job\nIt should also be clear by this point that when it comes to large\norganizations, major transformation is in store for senior management roles\nworldwide. There is no question that given the multiple transformational\ntechnologies converging at numerous intersection points, existing corporateexecutives will experience extreme stress. And as we’ve said, nowhere will\nthis impact be more deeply felt than in the office of the CEO. Indeed, it is\nvery likely that a decade from now, the job of the CEO will be so completely\nrevolutionized as to deserve a new title: Chief Expone ntial Officer.\nAll hail the CXO! And best of luck to that remarkable individual.\nBecause the CXO (not to mention the rest of us) is in for a wild and scary but\nultimately exhilarating ride as we enter the age of the Exponential\nOrganization.E P I L O G U E\nA New Cambrian Explosion\nTwo key questions we asked ourselves at the beginning of this journey were:\nAre ExOs for real? And if so, will they last?\nPut another way, is the ExO paradigm sustainable or is it just a flash in the\npan?\nThe following table shows the market cap of some top ExOs from when\nwe first started writing this book . We’re confident it answers the above\nquestions loud and clear.\nWhat a difference thirty-six months make—more importantly, this kind of\nmultiple would never show up in any five year strategic plan. Remember our\nIridium moment. Although it is a relatively new paradigm that is evolving\nquickly, there is no question in our minds that ExOs are here to stay—bu siness",

        "contents": "innovator Nilofer Merchant calls them “800-ounce gorillas.” Leveraging\nSCALE elements allows ExOs to extend themselves beyond traditional\nboundaries, and the IDEAS elements help retain control and some semblance\nof order. In fact, we are seeing a fascinating development in companies like\nAmazon, Facebook  and Google who have full implementation of the IDEAS\nelements: they become depoliticized. By making data-driven, objective\ndecisions (Experimentation), self-directed teams (Autonomy), constant shared\nawareness (Social) and Dashboards, teams focus on the end result rather than\ninternal politics.\nAnd for existing organizations, the Chapter Ten example of Arjun\nViswanathan at Citigroup shows how dramatically you can make an impact by\napplying ExO thinking into an existing organization. Ian Chan, a partner at\nDeloitte Canada whose enviable title is “Disruption Leader”, has already\nformed a team to implement ExO principles for their clients.\nTheir extreme performance and scalability comes as a result of either\ndominating new markets with information services, or attacking existing ones\nby dropping the cost of supply and virtually taking out the denominator in the\nrevenue/cost equation.\nHere’s another tangible example: In 1979 General Motors employed\n840,000 employees and generated $11 billion in earnings (in 2012 dollars).\nNow, let’s compare GM to Google, which in 2012 employed 38,000 (less\nthan 5 percent of GM’s 1979 workforce) and generated $14 billion in\nearnings (120 percent of GM’s). What a difference an information-based\nenvironment can make! In fact, the recent book  by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan\nRosenberg, How Google Works, maps almost completely to our IDEAS\nelements.\nSo, now that we know ExOs are here to stay, here are a few new questions\nto think about: How far into the general economy will ExOs penetrate? How\nmany industries and markets will they upend? How many established and(currently) successful companies will disappear in the face of exponential\ncompetitors? And finally, how would an ExO economy change the way we\nlive and work?\nIn addition to the extraordinary financial progress achieved by the\norganizations listed above , we have also tracked their organizational progress\nas they systematically implemented each of the ExO elements (MTP, SCALE\nand IDEAS). (And we’ll continue to track their evolution at\nwww.exponentialorgs.com.) Along the way, we’ve come to appreciate that\nthe best analogy for an ExO is the Internet itself. The Internet is a distributed,\ndecentralized architecture, with open standards and innovation occurring at\nthe edges. Startups with ExO attributes mirror that same set of characteristics.\nAfter twenty years of being the edge of innovation, the Internet is now the\nfoundation of almost all innovation. As enterprises grow more exponential, it\nis our belief that they will become distributed, decentralized platforms\nleveraging communities with open APIs. We also believe they will operate\nwith a balanced mix of open and protected data, encouraging constant and\ndisruptive innovation at their edges.\nIn the same way that Internet communications have seen costs drop to near\nzero, we expect to see internal organizational and transactions costs also fall\nto near zero as we increasingly information-enable and distribute our\norganizational structures. Ultimately, in the face of such low transaction costs,\nwe anticipate what we’re calling a Cambrian Explosion in organizational\ndesign—everything from community-based structures to virtual organizations\n(see Ethereum) that will be small, nimble and extensible.\nIt is also becoming increasingly clear that, like the Internet, the ExO\nparadigm is not just for business. It can just as easily be applied to all sorts of\nenterprises and organizations, from academia to non-profits to government. In\nshort, it is not just a system of commerce, but also a philosophy  of action.For example, what would an exponential government look like?\nEntrepreneur and technology strategist Andrew Rasiej believes governments\nshould be platforms for civic engagement. Jerry Michalski, founder of the\nRelationship Expedition (REX), notes that the true task of government should\nbe to manage the commons—the cultural and natural resources that belong to\nall members of a society—a system more effectively handled by MTP-driven\ncommunities than by elected, corruptible officials with often-suspect motives.\nFrankly, from the right perspective, traditional representative government\ncan be seen as just a rudimentary version of an ExO. That is, it has an MTP\n(its country or region), leverages community and crowd (tax collection as\ncoerced crowdfunding), is decentralized, gathers and leverages data and\ninsights, puts the community first (in theory), leverages engagement (civics\nand elections), and has extensive assets (public lands) and staff on demand\n(the armed forces and reserves).\nSo the real question is not whether governments can become ExOs—in a\ncrude way, they already are—bu t whether or not they are able to fulfill their\ndestiny to be true, fully functional, technology driven, high-performance\nmodern ExOs. In fact, here’s what we really should be asking ourselves: What\nwould such a government look like?\nThe opportunity for governments to fulfill that destiny certainly exists. In\nfact, a couple of ExO-style governmental systems have already been realized.\nThe protection of the Lesser Prairie Chicken, an endangered species in the\nSouthern Great Plains of the U.S., has ironically had a negative effect on\nanyone trying to erect a wind turbine in the region. The process to assess\nhabitat impact was taking over six months. Each aspect of an assessment\nrequired approval at every step. Finally, a group of agencies, including\nWildlife & Parks, created a GIS system that encoded all the sensitive areas.\nNow, the system approves a new location instantly and offers alternatives ifthere’s a problem. That’s an almost millionfold improvement in elapsed time,\nand all with minimal effort.\nSuccessful implementation of ExO strategies within a governmental\norganization can also be found in the UK. Mike Bracken, head of the\nGovernment Digital Service, runs his department as if it were an ExO.\nConstant experimentation with users, fast iterations, citizen-centered design\nand the use of GitHub repositories have resulted in a 90 percent approval\nrating for the department’s latest app. (When was the last time any government\nservice saw approval numbers like that?)\nAside from government, we believe ExO principles will transform other\nsiloed areas as well. Take scientific research, which, bizarrely, is still\nfiercely attached to the “publish or perish” mantra.\n“A strong publishing record is key to getting grant funding,” says Sarah\nSclarsic, a biotech executive with Modern Meadow who has been researching\nthis issue. The problem, however, is that top scientific journals favor\nsensational studies with positive-correlation findings. As a result, she says,\nscientists feel pressure to produce those sensational outcomes, regardless of\nwhether or not the science is sound. Sclarsic notes that when researchers at\nAmgen recently tried to reproduce the results of fifty-three landmark cancer\npapers, they were only able to substantiate six (11 percent). “This\n[publishing] bias undermines the open inquiry and objectivity that lie at the\nheart of science, and which is critical for the discipline’s success.”\nThankfully, new initiatives like figshare and the Public Library of Science\n(PLOS) are breaking down this archaic structure. Researchgate, an ExO, is an\nopen, community-based website where researchers can publish all results—\nand scientists and researchers are flocking to the site in droves. Now over\nfive million strong, the ResearchGate community alone might well multiply\nscientific and technological progress by orders of magnitude.Jobs and The Economy\nOther, equally important questions to contemplate as we move into an ExO\nenvironment: What kind of economy would an ExO world produce? What\nhappens as we information-enable more and more processes and products?\nPaint a picture of an information-enabled world and you’re liable to elicit\na typically dystopian scenario: robots and other forms of artificial intelligence\nobviate the need for our jobs and we collapse into crisis and social chaos.\nThe effect of technology on the economy is hardly a new conversation. The\nMcCormick reaper in the 1870s , the assembly line in the early twentieth\ncentury, the computer in the 1950s —we’ve heard it all before. Marc\nAndreessen has pointed out that the robots-will-take-our-jobs argument first\ntook place in 1964, relying on the exact same terminology and engendering the\nsame fears we’re seeing in the press today. In a recent discussion with Salim,\nnoted economist John Mauldin said he stands with Andreessen in not\nbelieving in a zero sum game. Instead, he holds that the economy will simply\nexpand to include new activities that could never have been imagined before.\n(That said, Mauldin also believes there are two oppos ing tensions at play in\nthe bigger economics picture, at least in the short term: governments making\nunsustainable promises regarding pensions, healthcare, etc., and increasing\nproductivity as a result of technology.)\nMauldin has criticized economists for their tendency to assess the\neconomy based on an assumption of equilibrium, pointing out that they almost\nnever realize that the information revolution inevitably disrupts this\nequilibrium. As W. Brian Arthur recently said: “Complexity economics is a\ndifferent way of thinking about the economy. It sees the economy not as a\nsystem in equilibrium but as one in motion, perpetually ‘computing’ itself—\nperpetually constructing itself anew. Where equilibrium economics\nemphasizes order, determinacy, deduction and stasis, this new frameworkemphasizes contingency, indeterminacy, sense-making and ope nness to change.\nUntil now, economics has been a noun-based rather than verb-based science.”\nWe believe very much in the optimistic Andreessen/Mauldin worldview.\nFor example, in 1980, only ninety-two craft brewers existed across the U.S.\nWhen our co-author Mike Malone’s father was writing about the beer industry\nin the 1980s , these “hobby ” breweries were considered little more than\nnovelties, unable to maintain consistent quality and targeted to a niche\naudience. Then, as technology drove costs lower, making the industry\naccessible to anyone and everyone, hobby ists and small brewers suddenly\nfound themselves in a position to run increasingly sophisticated, high quality\nmicrobreweries. Today there are almost 3,000 m icrobreweries in the U.S., the\nmost in over a century. Among them, they have created 110,000 jobs across\nthe country.\nBut that’s not all. A 2010 study conducted by the Kauffman Foundation\nfound that over the past forty years, big companies have created zero new net\njobs. Instead, 100 percent of new job creation has come via startups and\nentrepreneurs. After tracking the popu lar Maker Movement, pioneered by\nDale Dougherty, The Grommet uncovered similar results, reporting that small\nbusinesses have created eight million new jobs since 1990, while large ones\nhave eliminated four million positions.\nAs we mentioned in Chapter Five, the democratization of technology\nallows individuals and small teams to follow their passions, be it drones,\nDNA synthesis or beer. We believe MTP communities leveraging accelerating\ntechnologies could dramatically create new economic oppor tunities, and we\nexpect to see an abundance of new occupations in the near future—albeit very\ndifferent from the kind of work we’re doing today. The question we may soon\nask one another is, “How do you occupy yourself?” rather than, “What’s your\njob?” Bottom line: the Cambrian Explosion is already underway.From Scarcity to Abundance\nFuturist Paul Saffo has noted that humanity started out as a producer\neconomy, transformed into a consumer economy and is now moving towards\nbecoming a creator economy. Over the centuries, money and commerce have\nbeen the main modes of discourse around the world. Today, however,\ninformation is rapidly supplanting money to become the main mode of\ndiscourse (note that information is already largely fungible). Perhaps the\neasiest way of framing this macro shift is as a move from scarcity to\nabundance. Jerry Michalski notes that in the past, scarcity meant value. That\nis, without scarcity, you didn’t have a business. Now that notion has been\nupended. Dave Blakely of IDEO thinks about ExOs in the following way:\n“These new organizations are exponential because they took something scarce\nand made it abundant.” Nokia bought Navteq, trying to buy, own and control\nscarcity, only to be leapfrogged by Waze, which managed to harness\nabundance.\nBasically, Exponential Organizations are about managing abundance, and\nan information-based world drives us towards that abundance. (As outlined\nearlier, Steven Kotler and Peter Diamandis’ book  Abundanc e demonstrates\nthe likelihood of  this outcome.)\nThus, the triumph of the Exponential Organization begins to look\ninevitable. In his 2014 book  The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet\nof Things, the Collabor ative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism,\nJeremy Rifkin presents a central thesis that strongly correlates with our\n“Drive to Demonetization” notion, presented in Chapter Five, in which we\npoint out that ExOs push marginal costs to near zero. Rifkin, however, makes\na much bigger point. He believes that what we’re seeing is a new economic\nsystem emerging for the first time since the rise of capitalism, a new world ofvery low or zero marginal costs, one that he refers to as the Collaborative\nCommons.\nAs you can imagine, this new economic system represents an enormous\nthreat to capitalism. Ironically, the very rise and ascendance of capitalism (to\nmake goods and services ever cheaper) has been so successful that, Rifkin\nbelieves, it will ultimately eat its creator, thereby destroying capitalism itself.\nThe key driver for this dynamic? Goods  and services being information-\nenabled on a global scale.\nOnly time will tell if Rifkin is correct, or at least partially correct, as this\nnew paradigm comes to dominate large sectors of modern life. But what is\ncertain is that Exponential Organizations are the key to managing the new age\nof the Collaborative Commons and the economies of Abundance.\nUnfortunately, and ironically, there is a scarcity of guidance for this new\nparadigm. Almost every business school case study today is now out of date,\nsince each teaches (abundantly) how to optimize and manage scarcity.\nCorrespondingly, most management practices, which predominantly focus on\nscaling efficiency, are also out of date. There is no MBA course that\ndemonstrates Interfaces and no management consultant who can advise Uber\nabout implementing algorithms.\nWe’ve noted that when ExOs get big, they become platforms that spawn\nother, smaller ExOs, much like a healthy and growing coral reef spawns all\nnumber of interesting creatures at its outer fringes. As industries become\nincreasingly information-enabled, we believe they will inevitably consolidate\nto a few big platforms per industry, each hosting a multitude of small ExOs at\ntheir vents and fissures.\nHowever all this plays out, one thing, we hope, is clear. The Exponential\nOrganization is the future for any enterprise with a strong information\ncomponent—which is, of course, every enterprise. You can enter this new\nworld now or later. But, in the end, you will enter it.Your responsibility to your employees, investors and customers demands\nthat you not wait. The instant a part of your business or industry is\ninformation-enabled, marginal costs will start to disappear and your\norganization will either take on ExO dynamics or disappear. Hesitate too long\nand you may soon watch your competitors accelerate away, leaving your\ncompany a mere footnote in their corporate histories.\nThere is no need, however, to end up a historical footnote. Think again\nabout the many examples of how exponential thinking and action have not only\nenabled disruptive new companies, but also driven stunning progress and\nchange in all kinds and sizes of organizations. You now have the instruction\nmanual for recreating yourself as an Exponential Organization. We invite you\nto start dow n that path today.\nSalim Ismail\nMike Malone\nYuri van Geest\nAs is clear from our “Top ExOs” chart at the beginning of  the Epilogue ,\nExO attributes are evolving qui ckly. If you ar e interested in staying current\non ne ws, tips and t ricks, and c ase studies, please join us at\nwww.exponentialorgs.com.Afterword\nSo there you have it, the blueprint for building an Exponential Organization.\nWhether you’re a three-person company, or a 30,000 person company,\nreinventing your company around the intrinsic and extrinsic attributes\nidentified in this book  are critical.\nWe can all point at companies we think of as linear (say GM) and\ncompanies we think of as exponential (say Google), but now we can actually\nmeasure that difference and know how and why they operate at a 25-fold\nperformance differential in revenue per employee, as Salim points out in the\nepilogue. Part of that 25x difference comes from the productivity tools (i.e.\nexponential technologies) now available. And granted they operate in\ndifferent industries, but it indicates directionally the broad shift from a\nmaterial-based world to an information-based one.\nWe have arrived at this perspective from our experiences at Singularity\nUniversity, where for the last six years, we’ve been learning from the top\nthought leaders, researchers and practitioners in accelerating technologies.\nWhat’s critical to note however, is that we literally are still at the very\nbeginning of the coming age of disruptive technologies. We haven’t seen\nanything yet. In the next decade or two, these accelerating tools will continue\nto grow in utility, and winner-take-all network effects will accelerate\nExponential Organizations to record heights.\nThe reality is that during this time of exponential change you must evolve\nyour company—you are either disrupting yourself or someone else is—\nsitting still equals death.",

        "contents": "To give you a better picture of the tsunami of change coming our way,\nallow me to paint the picture of four levels of convergence set to unfold in\nthe near future.\nLevel I: First, we have the continued acceleration of specific exponential\ntechnologies riding on top of computation, which continues to double (aka\nMoore’s Law). This is occurring in areas such as Infinite Computing,\nNetworks/Sensors, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Digital Manufacturing\nand Synthetic Biology. You have seen the tables in Chapter One showing\ndramatic progress in all these areas.\nLevel II: The convergence of these technologies—the intersection of\nNetworks, AI and 3D printing—will soon allow anyone to describe their\nthoughts. We will have AI enabled design software listening to you describe\nbeautiful, detailed 3D printable designs, which will then be printed and\ndelivered to your doorstep. Every one of us, with or without skills, becomes\na master designer and manufacturer, in much the same way that Microsoft\nWord makes us all perfect spellers.\nLevel III: As mentioned in the book , in this decade the number of\ndigitally connected people on Earth will grow from two billion in 2010 to at\nleast five billion by 2020. The addition of three billion new minds entering\nthe global economy will have a powerful impact, but importantly, three\nbillion people will be fully empowered with dematerialized, demonetized\nand democratized technologies ranging from mobile phones to Google to\nonline 3D printing, AI techniques, medical diagnostics and synthetic biology.\nThey will have access to technologies that only a decade ago were only\navailable to the largest corporations and government labs. What will that\nenable? What will they build?\nLevel IV: We have seen that the rate of innovation on Earth increases as\na direct effect of people concentrating in cities (moving from the rural areas).Five years ago, the proportion of urban dwellers globally crossed the 50\npercent threshold for the first time in human history. To paraphrase Matt\nRidley, author of the important book  Rational Optimist: How Prosperity\nEvolves, ideas are having sex, mating and recombining at a faster and faster\nrate, driven by urbanized people in close proximity exchanging and iterating\nideas. Soon, the global mind of five billion connected people will drive the\nmost rapid iteration of technology ever seen. Innovation cycles on new\nproducts will go from years, to months, to weeks. How will the intellectual\nproperty system and global governance systems keep up? How will\ncorporations with large scale linear thinking manage? What happens when\nthe rate of change is faster than the patent process? Will corporations and\ngovernments be able to handle this rate of change?\nIt is these four levels of disruption that will be driving the tsunami of\nchange ahead of all of us. Ultimately, this book  was created to help you learn\nto surf on top of  that tsunami instead of being crushed by it.\nBoth Salim and I have spent the past two years crisscrossing the globe\nkeynoting, coaching and advising corporate and national leaders who are\nwaking up to fact that exponential technologies are here to stay, and these\ntechnologies are, in fact, accelerating. Those who thought the “Internet thing”\nwas an isolated incident from the last decade, have finally realized it was\nonly the beginning of everything.\nI wish you all the best, in taking your company, your organization,\nperhaps even your country, from a linear thinking entity to an Exponential\nOrganization.\nPeter H.

Malone\nand Yuri van Geest, with key ideas and framing provided by Peter\nDiamandis, along with consultation from the faculty of Singularity University.\nIsmail and Diamandis became business partners when they founded\nSingularity University, an institution created to study the impact of\nexponentially growing technologies on companies, industries and humanity’s\ngrand challenges. Van Geest has been involved in the collaboration, writing,\nresearching and thinking of this book  for almost the entire three years of its\ncreation. Malone is considered by many to be the writer of record for Silicon\nValley and has written two dozen book s, several of which identify key new\nmilestones in the history of organizations.\nSALIM ISMAIL is the founding Executive Director at Singularity University,\nwhere he moderates most academic programs, and is its current Global\nAmbassador. Before that, as a vice president at Yahoo, he built and ran\nBrickhouse, Yahoo’s internal incubator. His most recent company, Angstro,\nwas sold to Google in August 2010. He has founded or operated seven early-\nstage companies including PubSub Concepts, which laid some of the\nfoundation for the real-time web. He also spent several years as a\nmanagement consultant with CSC Europe and later with ITIM Associates.\nIsmail holds a BSc in Theoretical Physics from the University of Waterloo in\nCanada.",

A small portion part of the help we received is\ngratefully acknowledged below:\nFirst, to Paul Saffo, who suggested that Salim write this book . (Though it\nis unclear to Salim whether Paul meant well or not, as this project almost\nfinished him.)\nSecond, to Peter Diamandis, who dove  in and helped frame many of the\nmajor concepts and how they were articulated in a way only Peter can.\nThird, to Michiel Schuurman, whose relentless research and analytics\nlaid a solid foundation on which the ideas could rest.\nFourth, to Sarah Sclarsic, whose prodigious brain helped frame some key\ninsights that emerged from the book .\nOur editor, Lauren Cuthbert, comes with halo attached and cleaned up\nwhat seemed like every second word. Similarly, Joe DiNucci and Atiya\nDavidson from Enabling Thought Leadership, who managed the process from\nend to end.\nThanks to Mary Cummings, Laura Duane and their colleagues at\nDiversion Books along with James Levine, Kerry Sparks and the whole team\nat Levine Greenberg Rostan Literary Agency.\nThanks also to the following readers, who reviewed the book  and\nprovided valuable insights, commentary and feedback.
