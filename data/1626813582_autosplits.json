The goal\nwas to create a new kind of university, one whose curriculum was constantly\nbeing updated. For that reason SU was never accredited—n ot because we\ndidn’t care, but because the curriculum was changing too fast. SU would\nfocus only on the exponentially growing (or accelerating technologies) that\nwere riding on the back of Moore’s Law. Areas like infinite computing,\nsensors, networks, artificial intelligence, robotics, digital manufacturing,\nsynthetic biology, digital medicine and nanomaterials. By design and desire,\nour students would be the world’s top entrepreneurs, as well as executives\nfrom Fortune 500 companies. Our mission: to help people positively impact\nthe lives of a billion people.\nThe idea for SU came together at a Founding Conference hosted at\nNASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley in September 2008. What I\nremember most clearly from the event was an impromptu speech given by\nGoogle co-founder Larry Page near the end of the first day. Standing before\nabout one hundred attendees, Page made an impassioned speech calling for\nthis new university to focus on addressing the world’s biggest problems: “I\nnow have a very simple metric I use: Are you working on something that can\nchange the world? Yes or no? The answer for 99.99999 percent of people is\n‘no.’ I think we need to be training people on how to change the world.\nObviously, technologies are the way to do that. That’s what we’ve seen in the\npast; that’s what’s driven all the change.”\nOne of the individuals in the audience listening to Page was Salim, who\nhad headed up Brickhouse, Yahoo’s intrapreneurial incubator. He, too, was\ntaken by that message, and within weeks, he joined Singularity as the\nuniversity’s founding Executive Director. Salim, having run several startupsbefore, navigated the usual crises that come with an early stage company and\nplayed a crucial role in making SU the success it is today. But perhaps most\nimportant of all, Salim pulled together the diverse thoughts and case studies\ntaught at SU and wove them together into a vision for a new kind of company,\none that operated at ten times the price performance of those just a decade\nago.\nIt was my pleasure to help frame the attributes, concepts and practices\nexhibited by Exponential Organizations, and to join Salim, Yuri van Geest,\nand Mike Malone in developing this book . Together, we have had the great\nfortune to study and understand how accelerating technologies are changing\nthe course of nations, industry and all of humanity, and to manifest Salim’s\n“how-to guide” for the Exponential Executive. Some of the work described\nin the chapters ahead emerged from my own book , Abundanc e: The Future Is\nBetter Than You Think (co-authored with Steven Kotler), as a framing of\nwhere we all could end up, but most of it applies to the companies of today\nand how they need to navigate there.\nSalim’s co-authors also deserve recognition. First is Yuri van Geest, a\nSingularity University graduate and one of the world’s leading experts in\nmobile, as well as a keen student of exponential technologies and trends.\nYuri has a background in organizational design and has been materially\ninvolved since early on in the project. Second is veteran high-technology\njournalist Mike Malone. Mike is not only a world-class technology reporter,\nbut also the inventor of two influential organizational models that preceded\nthis book : the Virtual Corporation (with Bill Davidow) and the Protean\nOrganization.\nSalim’s vision of the Exponential Organization is a powerful one. Potent\nforces are emerging in the world—e xponential technologies, the DIY\ninnovator, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and the rising billion—that willgive us the power to solve many of the world’s grandest challenges and the\npotential to meet the needs of every man, women and child over the next two\nto three decades. These same forces are now empowering smaller and\nsmaller teams to do what was once only possible via governments and the\nlargest corporations.\nThree billion new minds will join the global economy over the next half-\ndozen years. The relevance of this is twofold. First, these three billion\npeople represent a new popu lation of consumers who have never bought\nanything before. Consequentially, they represent a long tail of tens-of-\ntrillions of dollars of emerging buying power. If they are not your direct\ncustomers, fear not; they are likely your customer’s customers. Second, this\ngroup—the “rising billion”—is a new entrepreneurial class powered with\nthe latest generation of Internet-delivered technologies—everything from\nGoogle and Artificial Intelligence, to 3D printing and synthetic biology. As\nsuch, we will see an explosion in the rate of innovation, as millions of new\ninnovators begin to experiment and upload their products and services and\nlaunch new businesses. If you think the rate of innovation has been fast in\nrecent years, let me be among the first to tell you: you haven’t seen anything\nyet.\nToday the only constant is change, and the rate of change is increasing.\nYour competition is no longer the multinational corporation overseas, it’s\nnow the guy or gal in the Silicon Valley or Bandra (Mumbai) garage using the\nlatest online tools to design and cloud print their latest innovation.\nBut the question remains: how can you harness all of this creative\npower? How can you construct an enterprise that is as quick, adept and\ninnovative as the people who will be part of it? How will you compete in\nthis accelerated new world? How will you organize to scale?\nThe answer is the Exponential Organization.You won’t have much choice, because in many (and soon most) industries,\nthat acceleration is already underway. Lately, I’ve begun to teach about what\nI call the 6Ds: Digitized, Deceptive, Disruptive, Dematerialize, Demonetize\nand Democratize.\nAny technology that becomes Digitized (our first “D”) enters a period of\nDeceptive growth. During the early period of exponentials, the doubling of\nsmall numbers (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08)  all basically looks like zero. But once\nits hits the knee of the curve, you are only ten doublings away from 1,000x ,\ntwenty doublings get you to 1,000,000x , and thirty doublings get you a\n1,000,000,000x  increase.\nSuch a rapid rise describes the third D, Disruptive. And, as you shall see\nin the pages of this book , once a technology become disruptive it\nDematerializes—which means that you no longer physically carry around a\nGPS, video camera or flashlight. All of them have dematerialized as apps\nonto your smartphone. And once that happens, the product or service\nDemonetizes. Thus, Uber is demonetizing taxi fleets and Craigslist\ndemonetized the classified ads (taking down a flock of newspapers in the\nprocess).\nThe final step to all this is Democratization. Thirty years ago if you\nwanted to reach a billion people, you needed to be Coca-Cola or GE, with\nemployees in one hundred countries. Today you can be a kid in a garage who\nuploads an app onto a few key platforms. Your ability to touch humanity has\nbeen democratized.\nWhat Salim and the team have observed from the front lines—and what\nyou will come to understand as you read this book —is that no current\ncommercial, governmental or non-profit enterprise, as currently configured,\ncan keep up with the pace that will be set by these 6Ds. To do s o will require\nsomething radically new—a new vision of organization that is astechnologically smart, adaptive and encompassing (not just of employees but\nof billions of people in vast social networks) as the new world in which it\nwill operate—and ultimately transform.\nThat vision is the Exponential Organization.\nPeter H. Diamandis\nFounder and Chairman, XPRIZE Foundation\nCo-Founder and Executive Chairman, Singularity University\nSanta Monica, CA\nAugust 25, 2014Introduction\nThe Iridium Moment\nIn the late 1980 s, in what was generally lauded as a forward-looking\nmove to capture the nascent cell phone industry, Motorola Inc. spun out a\ncompany called Iridium. Motorola recognized—be fore anyone else—that\nwhile expensive mobile phone solutions were relatively easy to implement in\nurban centers thanks to their high popu lation densities, there was no\ncomparable solution for regions outside major cities, much less the\ncountryside. A calculation convinced Motorola that the cost of cell phone\ntowers—about $100,000 each, not including spectrum utilization limits and\nthe not-inconsiderable expense of producing brick-sized handsets—meant that\nit would be too expensive to blanket the vast majority of the landscape.\nSoon enough, however, a more radical but also more profitable solution\npresented itself: a constellation of seventy-seven satellites (Iridium is number\nseventy-seven on the periodic table) that would cover the globe at low Earth\norbit and provide mobile telephony for one price—no matter the location.\nAnd, Motorola concluded, if just a million people in various developed\ncountries paid $3,000 for a satellite phone, plus a $5-per-minute usage fee,\nthe satellite network would quickly become profitable.\nOf course, we now know Iridium failed spectacularly, ultimately costing\nits investors $5 billion. In fact, the satellite system was doom ed before it was\neven put in place, one of the most dramatic victims of technological\ninnovation.",

        "contents": "companies, automotive companies and energy companies routinely find\nthemselves making investments whose returns might not be known for many\nyears.\nAlthough a workable system, it is far from an optimal one. Too much\nmoney and valuable talent is locked up in decade-long projects whose\nlikelihood of success can’t be measured almost until the moment they fail. All\nof which adds up to enormous waste, not least in terms of lost potential to\npursue other ideas and oppor tunities that could benefit mankind.\nThis is neither a tenable nor an acceptable situation, especially when the\nchallenges that face mankind in the twenty-first century will take every bit of\nthe imagination and innovation we can muster.\nThere must be a better way to organize ourselves. We’ve learned how to\nscale technology; now it’s time we learned how to scale organizations. This\nnew age calls for a different solution to building new business, to improving\nrates of success and to solving the challenges that lie ahead.\nThat solution is the Exponential Organization.\nExponential Organizations\nLet’s begin with a definition:\nAn Exponential Organization (ExO) is one whose impact (or\noutput) is disproportionally large—at least 10x larger—\ncompared to its peers because of the use of new\norganizational techniques that leverage accelerating\ntechnologies.Rather than using armies of people or large physical plants, Exponential\nOrganizations are built upon information technologies that take what was once\nphysical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.\nEverywhere you look you see this digital transformation taking place: In\n2012, 93 percent of U.S. transactions were already digital; physical\nequipment companies like Nikon are seeing their cameras rapidly being\nsupplanted by the cameras on smartphones; map and atlas makers were\nreplaced by Magellan GPS systems, which themselves were replaced by\nsmartphone sensors; and libraries of book s and music have been turned into\nphone and e-reader apps. Similarly, retail stores in China are being replaced\nby the rise of e-commerce tech giant Alibaba, universities are being\nthreatened by MOOCs such as edX and Coursera, and the Tesla S is more a\ncomputer with wheels than it is a car.\nThe sixty-year history of Moore’s Law—ba sically, that the price/performance\nof computation will double about every eighteen months—has been well\ndocumented. And we’ve come a long way since 1971, when the original\ncircuit board held just two hundred chips; today we have teraflops of\ncomputing operating within the same physical space.\nThat steady, extraordinary, and seemingly impossible pace led futurist Ray\nKurzweil, who has studied this phenomenon for thirty years, to make four\nsignature observations:\nFirst, the doubling pattern identified by Gordon Moore in integrated\ncircuits applies to any information technology. Kurzweil calls this the\nLaw of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) and shows that doubling patterns\nin computation extend all the way back to 1900, far earlier than Moore’s\noriginal pronouncement.Second, the driver fueling this phenomenon is information. Once any\ndomain, discipline, technology or industry becomes information-enabled\nand powered by information flows, its price/performance begins\ndoubling approximately annually.\nThird, once that doubling pattern starts, it doesn’t stop. We use current\ncomputers to design faster computers, which then build faster computers,\nand so on.\nFinally, several key technologies today are now information-enabled and\nfollowing the same trajectory. Those technologies include artificial\nintelligence (AI), robotics, biotech and bioinformatics, medicine,\nneuroscience, data science, 3D printing, nanotechnology and even\naspects of energy.\nNever in human history have we seen so many technologies moving at\nsuch a pace. And now that we are information-enabling everything around us,\nthe effects of the Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns are sure to be\nprofound.\nWhat’s more, as these technologies intersect (e.g., using deep-learning AI\nalgorithms to analyze cancer trials), the pace of innovation accelerates even\nfurther. Each intersection adds yet another multiplier to the equation.\nArchimedes once said, “Give me a lever long enough, and I’ll move the\nworld.” Simply put, mankind has never had a bigger lever.Kurzweil’s Law of Accelerating Returns and Moore’s Law long ago broke\nfrom the confines of semiconductors and have utterly transformed human\nsociety over the last fifty years. Now, Exponential Organizations, the latest\nembodiment of acceleration in human culture and enterprise, are overhauling\ncommerce and other aspects of modern life, and at a scorching pace that will\nquickly leave the old world of “linear organizations” far behind. Those\nenterprises that don’t jump aboard soon will be left on the ash heap of history,\njoining Iridium, Kodak, Polaroid, Philco, Blockbuster, Nokia and a host of\nother once-great, industry-dominant corporations unable to adapt to rapid\ntechnological change.In the pages ahead, we will outline the key internal and external attributes of\nan Exponential Organization, including its design (or lack thereof), lines of\ncommunication, decision-making protocol, information infrastructure,\nmanagement, philosophy and life cycle. We will explore how an ExO differs\nin terms of strategy, structure, culture, processes, operations, systems, people\nand key performance indicators. We will also discuss the crucial importance\nof a company having what we call a Massive Transformative Purpose (a term\nwe will define in depth). We will then look at how to launch an ExO startup,\nhow to adopt ExO practices in mid-cap companies and how to retrofit them to\nlarge organizations.\nOur objective is to not make this a book  of theory, but rather to present the\nreader with a how-to guide to the creation and maintenance of an Exponential\nOrganization. We offer a hands-on, prescriptive look at how to organize an\nenterprise able to compete in the face of today’s accelerated pace of change.\nAlthough many of the ideas we will present may seem radically new, they\nhave been around, sub rosa, for a decade or more. We first identified the ExO\nparadigm as a weak signal in 2009, and noticed over a two-year period that\nseveral new organizations were following a specific model. In 2011, futurist\nPaul Saffo suggested to Salim that he write this book , and we have been\nseriously researching the ExO model for the last three years. To do s o, we:\nReviewed sixty classic innovation management book s by such authors as\nJohn Hagel, Clayton Christensen, Eric Ries, Gary Hamel, Jim Collins,\nW. Chan Kim, Reid Hoffman and Michael Cusumano.\nInterviewed C-Level executives from several dozen Fortune 200\ncompanies with our survey and frameworks.Interviewed or researched ninety top entrepreneurs and visionaries\nincluding Marc Andreessen, Steve Forbes, Chris Anderson, Michael\nMilken, Paul Saffo, Philip Rosedale, Arianna Huffington, Tim O’Reilly\nand Steve Jurvetson.\nInvestigated the characteristics of the one hundred fastest growing and\nmost successful startups across the world, including those that comprise\nthe Unicorn Club (Aileen Lee’s name for the billion-dollar market cap\nstartup group), to tease out commonalities the companies used to scale.\nReviewed presentations and gleaned key insights from core faculty\nmembers at Singularity University regarding the acceleration they are\nseeing at the edges of their fields and how that acceleration might impact\norganizational design.\nWe don’t claim to have all the answers. But based upon our own\nexperiences, both good and bad, we believe we can offer management teams\ncritical insight into this era of hyper-accelerated innovation and competition,\nas well as into the new oppor tunities (and responsibilities) presented by this\nnew world. If we can’t guarantee you success, we can at least put you on the\nright playing field and show you the new rules of the game. These two\nadvantages, plus your own initiative, offer good odds  for being a winner in\nthe new world of Exponential Organizations.Part One\nExploring the Exponential\nOrganization\nIn this segment, we’ll explore the characteristics, attributes and implications\nof Exponential Organizations.",

        "contents": "Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla conducted an insightful piece of research\nin which he reviewed predictions made by mobile phone industry analysts\nfrom 2000 to 2010. He studied major research firms such as Gartner,\nForrester, McKinsey and Jupiter to see how they predicted the growth of the\nmobile phone industry in two-year increments over the course of that decade.\nKhosla’s research showed that in 2002 experts predicted, on average, 16\npercent year-to-year growth. In fact, by 2004, the industry had seen a 100\npercent increase. In 2004, their collective predictions called for an increase\nof 14 percent; by 2006, growth had once again climbed 100 percent. In 2006,\nthe analysts estimated sales would increase just 12 percent—and they\ndoubled again. Despite three previous—and notable—failures, in 2008 these\nvery same experts forecast a measly 10 percent growth, only to see the\nnumber double yet again—another 100 percent leap. It is hard to imagine\nhow anyone could be more wrong than to be off by 10x—and yet these were\nthe mobile phone industry experts upon whom corporations and governments\nworldwide relied for their long-term strategic planning. Nowhere does the\nphrase “missed by a country mile” seem more appropriate.\nWhat makes this failure valuable for our purposes is that at each point of\nexpone ntial growth in mobile phones over the last decade, the world’s top\nprognosticators predicted largely linear change. Again, we would label it\nIridium thinking.\nKhosla’s research proved particularly compelling and valuable when he\nwent on to show that such prediction errors weren’t unique just to the mobile\nphone industry, but also to the oil industry and a host of other sectors. It\nseemed that, when facing exponential growth, the experts in almost every\nfield always projected linearly, despite the evidence before their eyes.\nBrough Turner, a noted entrepreneur in VOIP and mobile telephony, has\nbeen building companies in that industry since 1990. Having kept close trackof industry predictions since the early 90s, he concurs with Khosla’s\nanalysis. In a recent interview with Salim, Turner noted that while the initial\nprojections were always aggressive, the experts inevitably expected a\ntapering after the first eighteen to twenty-four months. Nonetheless, he said,\nthe same rates of growth continued for twenty years. David Frigstad, CEO of\nresearch firm Frost & Sullivan, explains at least part of the problem thusly:\n“Predicting a technology when it’s doubling is inherently tricky. If you miss\none step, you’re off by 50 pe rcent!”\nA final example should drive the point home. In 1990, the Human\nGenome Project was launched with the aim of fully sequencing a single\nhuman genome. Estimates called for the project to take fifteen years and cost\nabout $6 billion. In 1997, however, halfway through the estimated time\nframe, just 1 percent of the human genome had been sequenced. Every expert\nlabeled the project a failure, pointing out that at seven years for just 1\npercent, it would take seven hundred years to finish the sequencing. Craig\nVenter, one of the principal researchers, received calls from friends and\ncolleagues imploring him to stop the project and not embarrass himself\nfurther. “Save your career,” he recalls them saying. “Return the money.”\nWhen Ray Kurzweil was asked his perspective, however, his view of the\n“impending disaster” was quite different. “1 percent,” he said. “That means\nwe’re halfway done.” What Kurzweil got that no one else did was that the\namount sequenced was doubling every year. 1 percent doubling seven times\nis 100 percent. Kurzweil’s math was correct, and in fact the project was\ncompleted in 2001, e arly and under budget. The so-called experts had missed\nthe end poi nt by 696 y ears.\nWhat is going on here? How can intelligent and well-read analysts,\nentrepreneurs and investors so consistently get things wrong? And not just a\nlittle wrong, but wrong by as much as 99 pe rcent?If such predictions had been just a little bit off, it would be easy to\ndismiss them as based on bad data, or even simple incompetence. But no,\nmistakes this great are almost always due to a complete misinterpretation of\nthe rules defining the nature of the marketplace. They come from relying on a\nparadigm that performed perfectly up until the moment it didn’t, and that is\nsuddenly, often inexplicably, out of date.\nBut if there is a new paradigm assuming a central role in the modern\neconomy, one that will define how we live and work, what is it?\nThe answer lies within the anecdotes cited in the introduction to this\nbook . Consider, for example, the Eastman Kodak story. Was its failure simply\na case of a once-great company that had grown complacent and lost its\ninnovative edge, as was suggested by the media at the time? Or was there\nsomething larger at work?\nThink back, if you are old enough to remember, to the days of film\nphotography. Each photograph cost an incremental amount of money. The cost\nof the film, the cost of mailing or hand-delivering the film, the cost of\nprocessing that film—in the end, it all added up to about a dollar per\nphotograph. Photography was based upon a scarcity model and we carefully\nconserved and managed our photos and film rolls to ensure no wasted shots.\nWith the shift to digital photography, something important—indeed\nsomething revolutionary—happened. The marginal cost of taking an extra\nphotograph didn’t just diminish, as it would with a linear improvement in the\ntechnology; instead, it essentially sank to zero. It didn’t matter if you took\nfive pictures or five hundred. The cost was the same. Eventually, even the\nstorage of the photos themselves became all but free.And that wasn’t the only technological leap. Once you had these digital\nphotographs, you could apply computations to them in the form of image\nrecognition, artificial intelligence, social technologies, filtering, editing, and\nmachine learning. Now anyone with minimal training could become a\n“darkroom wizard” like Edward Weston or Ansel Adams. You could also\nmanipulate, move and copy a digital photograph infinitely more quickly and\neasily than a physical one—and as such you became a publisher as well as a\nprint and wire service. And all these things could be done with a camera that\nwas a fraction the cost and size of the traditional analog versions it replaced.\nIn other words, what happened in the world of photography wasn’t just a\nmajor improvement. It wasn’t even just a single evolutionary leap. Eastman\nKodak might have managed to stay competitive had that been the only\nchallenge. But Kodak (and Polaroid, among other giants in the field) was hit\nby revolutionary technological change coming at it from multiple directions:\ncameras, film, processing, distribution, retailing, marketing, packaging,\nstorage and, ultimately and most decisively, a radical change in the\nperceptions of the marketplace.\nThat is the very definition of a paradigm shift. There’s an important and\nfoundational lesson illustrated in each of these anecdotes, which is that an\ninformation-based environment delivers fundam entally disruptive\noppor tunities.\nThere are thousands of similar disruptions taking place across the global\neconomy, where just such a profound shift is occurring from a physical\nsubstrate to an information substrate. That is, at the heart of every one of\nthese disruptions—these evolutionary leaps—can be found a fundamental\nchange in the role of information: semiconductor chips assuming the role of\nimage capture, display, storage and controller; the Internet transforming\nsupply, distribution and retail channels; and social networks and groupwarereorganizing institutions. Together, all indications are that we are shifting to\nan information-based par adigm.\nIn his book The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,\nKurzweil identified a hugely important and fundamental property of\ntechnology: when you shift to an information-based environment, the pace of\ndevelopment jumps onto an exponential growth path and price/performance\ndoubles every year or two.\nAs everyone in technology knows, this pace of change was first\ndiscovered and described in 1964 by Intel Corporation co-founder Gordon\nMoore. His discovery, immortalized as Moore’s Law, has seen the doubling\nof price/performance in computing continue uninterrupted for a half-century.\nAs noted in the Introduction, Kurzweil took Moore’s Law several steps\nfurther, noting that every information-based paradigm operates in the same\nway, something he called the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR).\nThere is a growing recognition that the pace of change formerly seen in\ncomputing is now mapping into other technologies with the same effect. For\nexample, the first human genome was sequenced in 2000 at a cost of $2.7\nbillion. Because of the underlying accelerations in computing, sensors and\nnew measurement techniques, the cost of DNA sequencing has been moving\nat five times the pace of Moore’s Law. In 2011, Dr. Moore had his own\ngenome sequenced for $100,00 0. Today that very same sequencing costs\nabout $1,000, a figure that is expected to drop to $100 by 2015, and to just a\npenny by 2020, when, in the words of Raymond McCauley, “It will soon be\ncheaper to sequence your genome…than it will be to flush your toilet.”\nWe’ve seen a similar movement in robotics. Those twenty dollar toy\nhelicopters all the kids are playing with? Five years ago that capability cost\n$700. Eight years ago it didn’t even exist. As former astronaut Dan Barry\nsays of a toy drone helicopter available on Amazon for seventeen dollars, “Ithas a gyro in it that space shuttle engineers would have spent $100 million to\nhave thirty years ago.”\nAnd that’s just biotech and robotics. We are also seeing plummeting costs\nacross a host of other technologies, including the following:\n3D printing\nCost (averages) for equivalent functionality: $40,000\n(2007)  to $100 ( 2014)\nScale: 400x  in 7 years\nIndustrial robots\nCost: $500,000 ( 2008)  to $22,000 ( 2013)\nScale: 23x in 5 years\nDrones\nCost: $100,000 ( 2007)  to $700 ( 2013)\nScale: 142x  in 6 years\nSolar\nCost: $30 pe r kWh (1984)  to $0.16 pe r kWh (2014)\nScale: 200x  in 20 y ears\nSensors (3D LIDAR sensor)\nCost: $20,000 ( 2009)  to $79 ( 2014)\nScale: 250x  in 5 years\nBiotech (DNA sequencing of one whole human DNA profile)\nCost: $10 m illion (2007)  to $1,000 ( 2014)Scale: 10,000x  in 7 years\nNeurotech (BCI devices)\nCost: $4,000 ( 2006)  to $90 ( 2011)\nScale: 44x in 5 years\nMedicine (full body  scan)\nCost: $10,000 ( 2000)  to $500 ( 2014)\nScale: 20x in 14 y ears\nIn each of these domains, at least one aspect is being information-\nenabled, which then catapults it onto the bullet train of Moore’s Law as the\npace of development accelerates into a doubling pattern.\nThe physical world is still there, of course, but our relationship to it is\nchanging fundamentally. Note that for many of us, our memories aren’t in our\nheads anymore—they’re buried in our smartphones. Via social networks, our\nrelationships are increasingly digital, not analog, and our communication is\nnearly all-digital. We are rapidly changing the filter through which we deal\nwith the world from a physical, materially-based perspective to an\ninformation- and knowledge-based one.\nAnd this is just beginning. Ten years ago we had five hundred million\nInternet-connected devices. Today there are about eight billion. By 2020\nthere will be fifty billion and a decade later we’ll have a trillion Internet-\nconnected devices as we literally information-enable every aspect of the\nworld in the Internet of Things. The Internet is now the world’s nervous\nsystem, with our mobile devices serving as edge points and nodes on that\nnetwork.\nThink about that for a second: we’ll be jumping from eight billion\nInternet-connected devices today to fifty billion by 2025, and to a trillion amere decade later. We like to think that thirty or forty years into the\nInformation Revolution we are well along in terms of its development. But\naccording to this metric, we’re just 1 percent of the way down the road. Not\nonly is most of that growth still ahead of us, all of it is.\nAnd everything is being disrupted in the process.\nThe magnitude of that disruption, especially in the consumer world, is\nonly now becoming obvious. It started with certain products and industries,\nsuch as book s (Amazon) and travel (Booking.com). Then classified ads\n(Craigslist) and auction sites (eBay) decimated the newspaper industry,\nwhich has been further disrupted in recent years by Twitter, the Huffington\nPost, Vice and Medium. More recently, entire industries—music, for\nexample, thanks initially to Apple’s iTunes—have been disrupted.\nNow, in 2014, we are hard-pressed to identify any industry that hasn’t\nbeen fundamentally disrupted. And not just businesses, but jobs as well. As\nDavid Rose, a leading angel investor and founder of Gust, says, “Every\nsingle job function we can identify is being fundamentally transformed.”\nEven “old” industries such as construction are in the throes of disruption.\nMike Halsall, a construction company executive, told us that significant\ndisruptions to his industry include:\nIncreased collaboration (making an opaque industry more transparent\nand substantially more efficient)\nEver-more sophisticated design software and visualization\n3D printing\nHalsall estimates that the sum of these disruptions could reduce the\nnumber of people working in construction by more than 25 percent within ten\nyears. (The construction industry, by the way, represents a $4.7 trillion\nindustry annually.) In the corporate travel industry, Russ Howell, EVP ofGlobal Technology at BCD Travel, notes that 50 percent of the transactions\nat telephone-based call centers moved to the Internet in less than a decade.\nFurthermore, he expects 50 percent of those to move to mobile smartphones\nwithin three years.\nAs this new information-based paradigm causes the very metabolism of\nthe world to heat up, we’re increasingly feeling its macroeconomic impact.\nFor example, the cheapest 3D printers now cost only $100, which means that\nwithin five years or so most of us will be able to afford 3D printers to\nfabricate toys, cutlery, tools and fittings—essentially anything we’re able to\ndream up. The implications of this “printing revolution” are almost\nunfathomable.\nSo are the potential repercussions. Consider that, for all of its advances\nover the past few decades, China’s economy is still fundamentally based on\nthe manufacturing and assembly of cheap plastic parts. This means that within\na decade, the Chinese economy could be under serious threat from 3D\nprinting technology. And that’s just one industry. (Next, consider the ripple\neffect if an economically distressed China decides to call its overseas debt.)\nHistorically, disruptive breakthroughs always occur when disparate fields\ncross. Consider, for example, how combining water power with the textile\nloom helped launch the Industrial Revolution. Today, we are essentially\ncross-connecting all innovative new fields. And not just new fields: similar\ncollisions are also occurring in age-old disciplines as well, from art and\nbiology to chemistry and economics. It’s no wonder that Larry Keeley,\nfounder of Doblin Group, a noted innovation strategy consulting firm, says, “I\nhave never, in thirty-two years, seen anything like the pace of change we’re\nseeing today.”Even industries that were once thought impervious to technology are being\naffected via second-order impacts of information. For example, in January\n2013 Santiago Bilinkis, a renowned entrepreneur in Argentina, noticed that\nBuenos Aires car wash operators had seen their revenues drop 50 percent\nover the previous decade. Given Argentina’s growing middle class, a steady\nincrease in the sales of luxury cars and a popu lation that takes pride in\nshowcasing clean cars, the fall in revenue made no sense. Bilinkis spent\nthree months researching the situation, checking whether there were more car\nwashes on the market (there weren’t) or if new water conservation rules had\nbeen introduced (they hadn’t). After eliminating all the possibilities, he\nstumbled upon the answer: Thanks to increased computing power and data,\nweather forecasters had become 50 percent more accurate in their\npredictions during that period. When drivers know it’s going to rain, they\nskip the car wash, resulting in fewer visits. Thus have computational\nimprovements in weather forecasting delivered a body  blow to an industry as\nseemingly immune to technology advances as Buenos Aires car wash\noperators.\nTo fully comprehend the sheer acceleration we’re seeing, recall the $10\nbillion in investment that was lost on Iridium and other satellite efforts in the\n90s. Today, twenty years later, a new breed of satellite companies—Skybox,\nPlanet Labs, Nanosatisfi and Satellogic—are all launching nanosatellites\n(which are, essentially, the size of a shoebox). The cost per launch is about\n$100,000 per satellite—a fraction of the $1 billion Iridium incurred per\nlaunch for its constellation. More important, by launching a cluster of\nnanosatellites operating in a coordinated, meshed configuration, thecapability of these new satellites blows away what the previous generation\ncould do.\nFor example, Planet Labs already has thirty-one satellites in orbit and\nplans to launch another one hundred during 2014. Satellogic, operating out of\nArgentina, has already launched its first three satellites and will soon be able\nto provide real-time video anywhere on earth to a one-meter resolution.\nEmiliano Kargieman, the founder of Satellogic, estimates the total cost of\nlaunching his fleet will be less than $200 million. All-told, this new breed of\nsatellite companies is operating at one-ten-thousandth the cost and delivering\nabout 100x  better performance than twenty years ago—a  millionfold\nincrease. Now that’s an Iridium Moment.\nKey Takeaways\nThe experts in many fields will project linearly\nin times of exponential change.\nThe explosive transition from film to digital\nphotography is now occurring in several\naccelerating technologies.\nWe are information-enabling everything.\nAn information-enabled environment delivers\nfundamentally disruptive oppor tunities.\nEven traditional industries are ripe for\ndisruption.CHAPTER TWO\nA Tale of Two Companies\nIn one of the most iconic moments in modern business history, Steve Jobs\nrocked the world in January 2007  with his announcement of the Apple iPhone,\nwhich debuted six months later.\nLiterally everything in high tech changed that day—indeed, you might even\ncall it a Singularity—as all existing strategies in consumer electronics were\ninstantly rendered obsolete. At that moment, the entire future of the digital\nworld had to be reconsidered.\nTwo months later, Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia spent a staggering\n$8.1 billion to buy Navteq, a navigation and road-mapping company. Nokia\npursued Navteq because the latter dominated the in-road traffic sensor\nindustry. Nokia concluded that control of those sensors would enable it to\ndominate mapping and mobile and online local information—assets that\nwould act as a defensive barrier against the increasing market predations of\nGoogle and Apple.\nThe stratospheric price tag represented Navteq’s near-monopoly of the\nroad sensor industry. In Europe alone, Navteq’s sensors covered\napproximately a quarter-million miles in thirty-five major cities across\nthirteen countries. Nokia was convinced that global, Navteq-powered, real-\ntime traffic monitoring would enable it to both compete with Google’s\ngrowing presence in real-time data and fend off Apple’s revolutionary new\nproduct.",

        "name": "Chapter Two: A Tale of Two Companies",
        "contents": "That was the theory, at least. Unfortunately for Nokia, a small Israeli\ncompany called Waze was founded around the same time.\nInstead of making a massive capital investment in in-road sensor\nhardware, the founders of Waze chose instead to crowdsource location\ninformation by leveraging the GPS sensors on its users’ phones—the new\nworld of smartphones just announced at Apple by Steve Jobs—to capture\ntraffic information. Within two years, Waze was gathering traffic data from as\nmany sources as Navteq had road sensors, and within four years it had ten\ntimes as many sources. What’s more, the cost of adding each new source was\nessentially zero, not to mention that Waze’s users regularly upgraded their\nphones—and thus Waze’s information base. In contrast, the Navteq system\ncost a fortune to upgrade.\nNokia made a gigantic defensive bet in acquiring an asset in the hopes of\nmaking an end-run around the iPhone. It was the kind of move that is\ncelebrated in business—if it succeeds, that is. But because Nokia didn’t\nunderstand the larger, exponential implications of Leveraged Assets (see\nChapter Three), the effort failed spectacularly. By June 2012, Nokia’s market\nvaluation had tumbled from $140 billion to $8.2 billion—pretty much what it\nspent to acquire Navteq. Not only had the world’s largest mobile phone\ncompany lost its lead but because it had also lost the capital needed to claw\nits way back, it also likely lost its role as a leading industry player forever.\nIn June 2013 Google acquired Waze for $1.1 billion. At that time, the\ncompany had no infrastructure, no hardware and no more than one hundred\nemployees. What it did have, however, was fifty million users. More\nprecisely, Waze had fifty million “human traffic sensors,” double those of just\na year before. That number has probably doubled again since then, to one\nhundred million location sensors globally.\nNokia followed the old linear rules and bought physical infrastructure\n(remember Iridium?), hoping it would prove to be a competitive barrier. Itwas, of course, but only for in-road sensor users, not against information-\nenabled mobile phone application designers. In contrast, Waze leapfrogged\nthe world of physical sensors simply by piggybacking on its users’\nsmartphones.\nIn a real-time epilogue to the Nokia/Navteq story, as we write this,\nMicrosoft has acquired Nokia’s cell phone device business and patent\nportfolio for $7.2 billion, or about $1 billion less than Nokia paid for Navteq.\nJust as Nokia has fallen far from its early lead in the cell phone industry,\nMicrosoft has struggled to gain share for its Windows Phone software.\nMicrosoft’s stated rationale for the Nokia deal is to accelerate its share\nand profits in phones; to create a first-rate Microsoft phone experience for\nusers; to prevent Google and Apple from foreclosing app innovation,\nintegration, distribution and economics; and to avail itself of an outsized\nfinancial oppor tunity fueled by growth in the smartphone industry. Time will\ntell how this scenario plays out, and whether Nokia’s acquisition is a case of\nlinear, exponential or just an intellectual property land grab.\nThe story of Waze versus Navteq is important, and relevant to this book , not\njust because of who won and who lost, but also because of the fundamental\ndifference in the two companies’ approaches to ownership. Nokia spent\nenormous resources to purchase and own billions of dollars in physical\nassets, while Waze simply accessed information already available on user-\nowned technology.\nThe former is a classic example of linear thinking, the latter of exponential\nthinking. While Nokia’s linear strategy was dependent on the speed of\nphysical installation, Waze benefited from the exponentially faster speed at\nwhich information can be accessed and shared.From time immemorial, human beings have worked to own “stuff” and then\ntrade access to it. This behavior started in tribes, was adopted by clans, and\nthen later spread to nations, empires, and most recently, global markets,\nmaking possible ever-larger human institutions. Value has always been\ngenerated by owning more land, more equipment, more machinery, more\npeople. Ownership was the perfect strategy for managing scarce resources\nand ensuring a relatively predictable, stable environment.\nThe more you had—that is, the more value you “owned”—the wealthier\nand more powerful you were. To manage that asset, of course, you needed\npeople. Lots of them. If a plot of land was twice as big, you needed twice as\nmany people to farm or protect it. Luckily, our span of control didn’t reach\nvery far across the landscape, so this was a perfectly workable arrangement.\nOnce we reached a critical mass of people needed to manage or protect\nour owned assets, we created hierarchies—in every tribe or village, there\nwas an implicit or explicit hierarchical order to the power structure. The\nbigger the tribe, the bigger the hierarchy. Then, beginning in the Middle Ages\nbut fully taking hold with the Industrial Revolution and rise of the modern\ncorporation, that local, hierarchical thinking was mapped onto companies and\ninto governmental structures, a design that with only limited modification has\nheld ever since.\nToday, we still manage and measure ourselves on this linear scale. That\nis: x amount of work takes y amount of resources, 2x needs 2y, and so on of\never-greater arithmetic magnitude.\nAutomation, mass production, robotics and even virtualization with\ncomputers altered the slope of this line, but it still remained linear. If one\nconcrete mixer truck replaces one hundred laborers hand-mixing concrete,\ntwo trucks replace two hundred laborers. Similarly, much of society is also\nmeasured on this basis: the number of doctors per 100,000 patients, class sizeper teacher, GDP and energy per capita. Labor is paid hourly, as are legal\nfees, and housing is priced by the square foot.\nIn business, the way we build most products and services continues to\nmirror this linear, incremental, sequential thinking. Thus, the classic way to\nbuild a product, be it a giant airliner or a thumbnail-sized microprocessor, is\nthrough a template stage-gate process called New Product Development, or\nNPD, which includes the following steps:\n1. Idea generation\n2. Idea screening\n3. Concept development and testing\n4. Business analysis\n5. Beta and market testing\n6. Technical implementation\n7. Commercialization\n8. New product pricing\nSo codified is this process into the DNA of modern business there is even\na designated industry association for it, called the Product Development and\nManagement Association (PDMA).\nYou might think that while this old-fashioned linear approach is still\nwidespread among mature industries, it has long been abandoned in the world\nof hot new technologies. You would be wrong. The linear process remains\npervasive across the world economy, taking on different names in its different\niterations. In software, for example, it’s been called the waterfall approach.\nAnd while new development methods, like Agile, have croppe d up to short-\ncircuit this approach and parallelize some of the steps, the basic paradigm is\nstill linear and incremental. Whether you are making locomotives or iPhone\napps, linear product development remains the predominant name of the game.See the diagram below, noting that this works when both problem and desired\nsolution are precisely known.\nWhen you think linearly, when your operations are linear, and when your\nmeasures of performance and success are linear, you cannot help but end up\nwith a linear organization, one that sees the world through a linear lens—as\ndid even multi-billion dollar, technologically cutting-edge Nokia. Such an\norganization cannot help but have many of the following characteristics:\nTop-down and hierarchical in its organization\nDriven by financial outcomes\nLinear, sequential thinkingInnovation primarily from within\nStrategic planning largely an extrapolation from the past\nRisk intolerance\nProcess inflexibility\nLarge number of employees\nControls own assets\nStrongly invested in status quo\nAs noted business author John Hagel said: “Our organizations are set up\nto withstand change from the outside,” rather than to embrace those changes\neven when they are useful. Aerospace engineer Burt Rutan’s corollary to this\nis, “Defend and don ’t question.”\nNot surprisingly, given all of these characteristics, linear organizations\nwill rarely disrupt their own products or services. They haven’t the tools, the\nattitude or the perspective to do so. What they will do, and what they are built\nto do, is to keep getting bigger in order to take advantage of economies of\nscale. Scale—bu t linear scale—is the raison d’être of the linear organization.\nJohn Seely Brown calls this “scalable efficiency” and maintains that it is the\nparadigm that drives most corporate strategy and corporate architectures.\nClayton Christensen immortalized this type of thinking in his business classic,\nThe Innov ator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to\nFall.\nMost large organizations use what is called a matrix structure. Product\nmanagement, marketing and sales are often aligned vertically, and support\nfunctions such as legal, HR, finance and IT are usually horizontal. So the\nperson handling legal for a product has two reporting lines, one to the head of\nproduct, who has revenue accountability, and the other to the head of legal,\nwhose job it is to ensure consistency across numerous products. This is great\nfor command and control, but it’s terrible for accountability, speed and risk\ntolerance. Every time you try to do something, you have to get authorizationfrom all the muckety-mucks in HR, legal, accounting and so on, which takes\ntime.\nAnother major issue Salim has observed with matrix structures is that,\nover time, power accrues to the horizontals. Often, HR or legal have no\nincentive to say yes, so their default answer becomes no (which is why HR is\noften referred to as “inhuman resources”). It’s not that HR people are bad\npeople. But, over time, their incentives end up at cross-purposes with those of\nproduct managers.\nOver the last few decades, the race to capture economies of scale has\nresulted in an explosion of large globalized corporations. At the same time,\nthe pressure for higher and higher margins has led to offshoring, international\nexpansion and mega-mergers in the name of cutting costs, increasing revenues\nand improving the bottom line.\nBut each of these changes comes at great cost, because the flip side of size\nis flexibility. However hard they try, large companies with extensive facilities\nfilled with tens of thousands of employees scattered around the world are\nchallenged to operate nimbly in a fast-moving world. In his analysis of\nexponential disruption, Hagel also notes: “One of the key issues in an\nexponential world…is that whatever understanding you have today is going to\nrapidly become obsolete, and so you have to continue to refresh your\neducation about the technologies and about the organizational capabilities.\nThat’s going to be very challenging.” Rapid or disruptive change is something\nthat large, matrixed organizations find extremely difficult. Indeed, those who\nhave attempted it have found that the organization’s “immune system” is liable\nto respond to the perceived threat with an attack. Gabriel Baldinucci, Chief\nStrategy Officer at Singularity University and a former principal at Virgin\nGroup’s U.S. venture arm, has observed that there are two levels of immune\nresponses. The first is to defend the core business because it’s the status quo;the second is to defend yourself as an individual because there’s more ROI for\nyou than for the organization.\nWhat makes traditional companies highly efficient at expansion and\ngrowth as long as market conditions remain unchanged is also what makes\nthem extremely vulnerable to disruption. As Peter Thiel said, “Globalization\nis moving from one to N copying existing products. That was the 20 century.\nNow in the 21 century we move into a world where zero to one and creating\nnew products will increasingly be a priority for companies due to the rise of\ndifferent exponential technologies.”\nWhatever else they may be, big companies aren’t stupid. They know about\nthis structural weakness and many are striving to fix it. For example, one of\nLarry Page’s first steps upon becoming CEO of Google in April 2011 was to\nstrip management layers and flatten the organization. Similar programs have\nbeen implemented at Haier, in China, and other large organizations. While\nsome of these fixes have proven successful, in the longer term, such flattening\nis merely a stopgap, because the total number of employees—the financial\nweight and resistance to change—rarely diminishes.\nOf course, not all industries are “going lean.” One industry headed in the\noppos ite direction is pharmaceuticals—to what we believe will be the\nindustry’s regret. Once the low-hanging fruit of blockbuster drugs began\nwinding down around 2012 , instead of breaking into smaller, more flexible\nunits, Big Pharma chose to pursue the consolidations and mergers that seemed\nto make Wall Street happy. We believe that increased size will reduce the\nflexibility of pharmaceutical companies even further, thus increasing their\nexposure to disruption.\nOne exemplar of that pending disruption is teenager Jack Andraka, who at\nthe age of fourteen single-handedly developed an early-stage detection test for\npancreatic cancer that costs just three cents. His approach (awaiting peer\nreview) is 26,000 times cheaper, 400 times more sensitive, and 126 timesth\nstfaster than today’s diagnostics. Big Pharma has no idea how to deal with Jack,\nwho is one of many wunderkinds emerging globally, all of them with the\npotential to disrupt great companies and long-established industries. The\nJacks of the world bring exponential thinking to our linear world—a nd\nnothing is going to stop them.\nGetting back to the Navteq versus Waze story, one thing we hope to make\nclear is that traditional linear thinking doesn’t work in an exponential world.\nSimply put, it cannot compete. Salim saw this firsthand at Yahoo in 2007,\nwhich despite its web bona fides, operated within a classic linear matrix\norganizational structure. Every time a new product was launched or an old\none modified, the team behind it had to jump through several clearance hoops\n—branding, legal, privacy and PR, etc.—each step taking days or weeks,\nwhich meant that by the time anything finally landed in the consumer Internet\nspace, it was usually too late; some startup or another had already gotten\ntraction. Salim’s conclusion about one root cause of Yahoo’s troubles is that\nits organizational structure is antithetical to the industry.\nYahoo is hardly alone. Even the mighty Google struggles with this. It took\ntwo years and enormous effort to get Google+ out the door. Even though the\nproduct is brilliantly crafted, by the time of its launch in the summer of 2011,\nFacebook  had an almost insurmountable lead.\nAs we saw in Chapter One, this pace of change isn’t going to slow down\nanytime soon. In fact, Moore’s Law all but guarantees that it will continue to\nspeed up—a nd speed up exponentially—for at least several decades. And\ngiven the cross impact into other technologies, if the last fifteen years has seen\nenormous disruption in the business world, the next fifteen will make that\ndisruption seem tame by comparison.\nInternet companies have changed the way we advertise and market. They\nhave transformed the world of newspapers and publishing. And they have\nprofoundly changed the way we communicate and interact with one another.One reason for that change is that the cost of distributing a product or service,\nparticularly if can be converted almost entirely to information, has droppe d\nalmost to zero. It used to require millions of dollars in servers and software to\nlaunch a software company. Thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), it now\ncosts just a tiny fraction of that amount. Similar stories can be found in every\ndepartment in every industry of the modern economy.\nHistory and common sense make clear that you cannot radically transform\nevery part of an organization—and accelerate the underlying clock of that\nenterprise to hyper-speed—w ithout fundamentally changing the nature of that\norganization. Which is why, over the last few years, a new organizational\nscheme congruent with these changes has begun to emerge. We call it the\nExponential Organization precisely because it represents the structure best\nsuited to address the accelerated, non-linear, web-driven pace of modern life.\nAnd while even cutting-edge traditional companies can only achieve\narithmetic outputs per input, an ExO achieves geometric outputs per input by\nriding the doubling-exponential pattern of information-based technologies.\nTo achieve this scalability, new ExO organizations such as Waze are\nturning the traditional organization inside out. Rather than owning assets or\nworkforces and incrementally seeing a return on those assets, ExOs leverage\nexternal resources to achieve their objectives. For example, they maintain a\nvery small core of employees and facilities, allowing enormous flexibility as\nmargins soar. They enlist their customers and leverage offline and online\ncommunities in everything from product design to application development.\nThey float atop the existing and emerging infrastructure rather than trying to\nown it. And they grow at incredible rates precisely because they aren’t\ndedicated to ow ning their market, but rather to enlisting it to their purposes. A\ngreat example is Medium, which is disrupting the magazine business by\nrelying on its users to provide long-form articles.It is our belief that ExOs will overwhelm traditional linear organizations\nin most industries because they take better advantage of the information-based\nexternalities inaccessible to older structures, a feat that will empower them to\ngrow faster—shockingly faster—than their linear counterparts, and then\naccelerate from there.\nIt’s hard to pin down exactly when this new organizational form emerged.\nVarious aspects of ExOs have been around for decades, but it is only over the\nlast few years that they have really started to matter. If we had to pick an\nofficial ExO origin date, it would be March 2006, when Amazon launched\nAmazon Web Services and created the low-cost “Cloud” for medium and\nsmall businesses. From that date on, the cost of running a data center moved\nfrom a fixed CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) cost to a variable cost. Today, it\nis almost impossible to find a single startup that doesn’t use AWS.\nWe have even found a simple metric that helps to identify and distinguish\nemerging Exponential Organizations: a minimum 10x improvement in output\nover four to five years.\nThe following shows some ExOs and their minimum 10x performance\ninprovement over their peers:\nAirbnb\nHotels90x more listings per employee\nGitHub\nSoftware109x  more repositories per employee\nLocal Motors\nAutomotive1000x  cheaper to produce new car\nmodel, 5-22x faster process for a car to\nproduce (depending on vehicle)\nQuirky\nConsumer Goods10x faster product development (29 da ys\nvs 300 da ys)\nGoogle Ventures\nInvestments2.5x more investments in early stage\nstartups, 10x  faster through designprocess\nValve\nGaming30x more market cap per employee\nTesla\nAutomotive30x more market cap per employee\nTangerine (formerly\nING Direct\nCanada)\nBanking7x more customers per employee, 4x\nmore deposits per customer\nLook again at Waze. By harnessing information on its users’ phones, Waze\ncurrently has one hundred times the traffic movement signals that\nNavteq/Nokia acquired by buying the physical sensors buried in roads. Even\nthough Waze was just a tiny startup company with just a few dozen employees,\nit quickly ran down and overtook the linear Nokia, despite its thousands of\nemployees. Nokia thought it dominated the mobile phone world—a nd while it\nonce had, within the new paradigm it didn’t stand a chance.\nTwo key factors enabled Waze to succeed, and those two factors hold true\nfor all next-generation ExO companies:\nAccess resources you don’t own. In Waze’s case, the company made use\nof the GPS readings already on its users’ smartphones.\nInformation is your greatest asset. More reliably than any other asset,\ninformation has the potential to double regularly. Rather than simply\nassembling assets, the key to success is accessing valuable caches of\nexisting information. Andrew Rasiej, chairman of the New York Tech\nMeetup, said it best: “I think of Waze as a civics app. It’s collecting\ninformation about the movement of cars and people in public places.\nWhat else could you do w ith that data?”Taking Rasiej’s observation a step further, the real, fundamental question\nof our exponential age is: What else can be  information-enabled?\nThe key outcome when you access resources and information-enable them\nis that your marginal costs drop to zero. Quite possibly the granddaddy of\ninformation-based ExOs is Google, which doesn’t own the web pages it\nscans. Its revenue model, the butt of many jokes ten years ago, has enabled\nGoogle to become a $400 billion company, a milestone it reached by\nessentially manipulating textual (and now video) information. LinkedIn and\nFacebook  together are worth over $200 billion, and that’s just as a result of\ndigitizing our relationships—that is, turning them into information. It is our\nbelief that most great new enterprises in the years to come will either build\ntheir businesses off new sources of information or by converting previously\nanalog environments into information. And that environment increasingly\nincludes hardware (sensors, 3D printers/scanners, biotech, etc.): As noted\nearlier, the Tesla S, which has just seventeen different moving parts in its\ndrivetrain, can be thought of as computer masquerading as a supremely\ncapable luxury car, one that it updates itself every week via a software\ndownload.\nThis search for new sources of information that can underpin new\ncompanies and businesses is at the heart of the revolution often labeled Big\nData. By combining vast stores of data with powerful new analytical tools,\nthere is an oppor tunity to see the world in a new way—and to turn the\nresulting information into new business oppor tunities.\nSources of this Big Data are emerging everywhere. For example, we\nmentioned the three separate initiatives for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nsystems that within a few years will deliver real-time video and images\nanywhere on the planet. Despite the inevitable privacy and security concerns\nbound to arise with the launch of LEO satellite systems, there is no doubt thatscores, even hundreds, of new businesses will emerge from access to this\nmassive new information source.\nFor instance, what if you could count the number of cars in any or all\nSears or Walmart parking lots throughout the country? Or predict natural\ncalamities like tsunamis and typhoons, as well as their impact? Or measure\nthe increasing wattage along the Amazon River at night? Or track every\ncontainer ship, in real time, around the world? Soon you can—either via\nnanosatellites or global Internet access initiatives such a Google’s Project\nLoon and Facebook ’s drones strategies.\nEven closer down this road is the Google autonomous automobile. The\nkey navigational technology it uses is light radar, also known as lidar. Each\ncar has a spinning lidar unit on its roof that creates a live 3D map of its\nsurroundings to a range of about one hundred meters. As it moves, a Google\ncar collects almost a gigabyte of data per second and creates a 3D image of\nits surroundings to within a one-centimeter resolution. It can even compare\ntwo images to get a perfect before-and-after analysis. If you move a plant off\nyour front porch, if you leave a window open or if your teenager sneaks out of\nhis or her bedroom at night, Google will know.\nThis is not just static information. It is also dynamic information—da ta\nthat registers the natural world not simply as it is, but as it changes. Mountains\n(petabytes) of data can be analytically sliced and diced to discover\npreviously unknown truths about the world around us—truths that will result\nin oppor tunities currently unimaginable.\nAs outlined earlier, traditional organizational structures, designed ove r the\nlast few hundred years to hierarchically manage physical assets or people, are\nrapidly becoming obsolete. To compete in our rapidly changing world, we\nneed a new kind of organization, one that is not only able manage this change,\nbut also thrives on it.We opened Chapter One with a discussion of what we refer to as the\nIridium Moment. By ironic coincidence, the extinction of the dinosaurs was\nrevealed by an iridium layer in rock formations; this time around, the\ndestructive agent is an Information Comet. What if we are having another,\ncollective Iridium Moment? One that doesn’t just involve a single giant\ncorporation that has failed to recognize the revolutionary nature of the\ntechnological change taking place around it, but a whole species—indeed the\ndominant species—of large corporations in the modern economy. What if they\nare all facing the same fate as Iridium?\nThat question, and the quest for a strategy that both established and new\ncompanies can use to survive and thrive in this new world will be the subject\nof the rest of this book . Exponential Organizations have the capability to adapt\nto this new world of deep and ubiquitous information and convert it to\ncompetitive advantage. The ExO, in fact, is the appropriate commercial\nresponse to our new exponential world.\nWe’ll next take a closer look at this remarkable new organizational form:\nhow it works, how it is organized, how it scales its operations and why it will\nsucceed in a transformed marketplace when other, established organizational\nschemes won’t. Most of all, we will explore why, if we are to succeed in\nbusiness, the Exponential Organization is our destiny.\nKey Takeaways\nOur organizational structures have evolved to\nmanage scarcity. The concept of ownership\nworks well for scarcity, but accessing or sharing\nworks better in an abundant, information-based\nworld.While the information-based world is now\nmoving exponentially, our organizational\nstructures are still very linear (especially large\nones).\nWe’ve learned how to scale technology; now it’s\ntime to scale the organization.\nMatrix structures don’t work in an exponential,\ninformation-based world.\nExOs have learned how to organize around an\ninformation-based world.\nDavid S. Rose, author of the bestselling book  Angel Investing: The Gust\nGuide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups, sums it up\nmore dramatically:\n“Any company designed for success in the 20  century is\ndoomed to failure in the 21.”th\nstCHAPTER THREE\nThe Exponential Organization\nThe modern corporation takes great pride in how fast it can bring products\nand services to market compared to companies in the past. Annual reports,\nadvertisements and speeches trumpet how companies have virtualized,\naccelerated supply chains, shortened approval cycles and improved\ndistribution channels.\nThe result is that it now takes an average of between two hundred fifty and\nthree hundred days for a typical Consumer Packaged Goods  (CPG) company\nto move a new product from invention to retail stores’ shelves—and that,\nbelieve it or not, is considered a blistering pace.\nConsider Quirky, a pioneering Exponential Organization in the same CPG\nindustry. It accomplishes this same cycle in just twenty-nine days. That’s\ntwenty-nine days from idea generation to seeing the product on sale at your\nlocal Walmart.\nA traditional car company spends about $3 billion to bring a new car\nmodel to market. Local Motors, an ExO, accomplishes the same thing for just\n$3 m illion—a 1,000x  improvement, albeit not to the same production scale.\nNext, consider Airbnb, a company that leverages users’ extra bedrooms.\nFounded in 2008, Airbnb currently has 1,324 employees and operates\n500,000 listings in 33,000 cities. However, Airbnb owns no physical assets\nand is worth almost $10 billion. That’s more than the value of Hyatt Hotels,\nwhich has 45,000 e mployees spread across 549 pr operties. And while Hyatt’s",

At its current pace, Airbnb will be the biggest hotelier\nin the world by late 2015.\nSimilarly, Uber, the Airbnb of cars—Uber converts private automobiles\ninto taxis—has been valued at $17 billion. Like Airbnb, Uber has no assets,\nno workforce (to speak of) and is also growing exponentially.If you don’t find these valuations sufficiently eye-opening, go back and\nread them again—this time reminding yourself that each of these Exponential\nOrganizations is fewer than s ix years old.\nAs we saw with Waze in Chapter Two, there are two fundamental drivers\nthat enable ExOs to achieve this level of scalability. The first is that some\naspect of the company’s product has been information-enabled and thus,\nfollowing Moore’s Law, can take on the doubling characteristics of\ninformation growth.\nThe second is that, thanks to the fact that information is essentially liquid,\nmajor business functions can be transferred outside of the organization—to\nusers, fans, partners or the general public. (We’ll revisit this concept later.)\nLet’s now examine the major characteristics of Exponential Organizations.\nBased on our research—which includes the top one hundred fastest growing\nstartups worldwide over the last six years—we have identified common traits\nacross all ExOs. They include a Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP), as\nwell as ten other attributes that reflect the internal mechanisms and\nexternalities they’re leveraging to achieve exponential growth. We use the\nacronym SCALE to reflect the five external attributes, and the acronym IDEAS\nfor the five internal attributes. Not every ExO has all ten attributes but the\nmore it has, the more scalable it tends to be. Our research indicates that a\nminimum of four implemented attributes will achieve the ExO label and have\nyou accelerate away from your competition.\nIn this chapter we will look at the Massive Transformative Purpose and\nthe five external attributes that comprise SCALE. In the next chapter we will\ninvestigate the five internal attributes that make up IDEAS. A good metaphor\nwe will use to frame ExO attributes is the two hemispheres of the brain.

        "contents": "Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)\nExponential Organizations, almost by definition, think BIG. There’s a\ngood reason for that: if a company thinks small, it is unlikely to pursue a\nbusiness strategy that will achieve rapid growth. Even if the company\nsomehow manages to achieve an impressive level of growth, the scale of its\nbusiness will quickly outpace its business model and leave the company lost\nand directionless. Thus, ExOs must aim high.\nThat’s why, when we look at the position statements of existing\nExponential Organizations, we encounter statements of purpose that might\nhave seemed outrageous in years past:\nTED: “Ideas worth spreading.”\nGoogle: “Organize the world’s information.”X Prize Foundation: “Bring about radical breakthroughs for the benefit\nof humanity.”\nQuirky: “Make invention accessible.”\nSingularity University: “Positively impact one billion people.”\nAt first glance, these statements may seem to align with the trend in recent\nyears to rewrite corporate statements to be shorter, simpler and more\ngeneralized. But on closer inspection, you’ll note that each of the statements is\nalso very aspirational. None states what the organization does, but rather\nwhat it aspires to accomplish. The aspirations are neither narrow nor even\ntechnology-specific. Rather, they aim to capture the hearts and minds—and\nimaginations and ambitions—of those both inside and (especially) outside the\norganization.\nThis, then, is the Massive Transformative Purpose, or MTP—the higher,\naspirational purpose of the organization. Every ExO we know has one. Some\naim to transform the planet, others just an industry. But radical transformation\nis the name of the game. And while companies of the past might have felt\nembarrassed to make such claims, today’s ExO declares with sincerity and\nconfidence that it intends to accomplish near-miracles. Even a company in a\ncomparatively small market can “think MTP”: Dollar Shave Club, for\nexample, is transforming the shaving industry with the mantra “A dollar a\nmonth.”\nIt’s important to note that an MTP is not a mission statement. Consider\nCisco’s mission statement, which is neither inspirational nor aspirational:\n“Shape the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and\noppor tunity for our customers, employees, investors, and ecosystem partners.”\nWhile there’s some Purpose there, and it’s somewhat Massive, it’s certainly\nnot Transformative. Furthermore, it is a statement that could be used by at\nleast a dozen Internet companies. If we were to write Cisco’s MTP, it wouldlikely be something along the lines of, “Connecting everyone, everything,\neverywhere—all the time.” Now that would be exciting.\nThe most important outcome of a proper MTP is that it generates a cultural\nmovement—what John Hagel and John Seely Brown call the “Power of Pull.”\nThat is, the MTP is so inspirational that a community forms around the ExO\nand spontaneously begins operating on its own, ultimately creating its own\ncommunity, tribe and culture. Think of those lines outside the Apple Store or\nthe waiting lists for TED’s annual conference. Each has an emergent\necosystem so excited about that product or service that it literally pulls the\nproducts and services out from the core organization and assumes its own\nownership, complete with marketing, support services, and even design and\nmanufacturing. Consider the Apple iPhone: with a universe of supporting\nproducts and a million user-generated applications, who really owns it?\nThis cultural shift inspired by the MTP has its own secondary effects. For\none thing, it moves the focal point of a team from internal politics to external\nimpact. Most contemporary large companies are internally focused and often\nhave lost touch—except through rigid and formalized marketing surveys and\nfocus groups—with their market and customers.\nIn our increasingly volatile world, this perspective can be fatal. It is\ncritical for a modern enterprise to constantly look outward—n ot least to spot\na rapidly approaching technological or competitive threat. If you’re at\nGoogle, you are constantly asking yourself (as per the company’s statement):\n“How can I better organize the world’s information?” At Singularity\nUniversity the question we ask ourselves at every turning point is: “Will this\npositively impact a billion people?”\nThe biggest imperative of a worthy MTP is its Purpose. Building on the\nseminal work by Simon Sinek, the Purpose must answer two critical “why”\nquestions:Why do this work?\nWhy does the organization exist?\nAn MTP as a Competitive Edge\nA strong MTP is especially advantageous to “first movers.” If the MTP is\nsufficiently sweeping, there’s no place for competitors to go but beneath it.\nAfter all, it would be very hard for another organization to pop up and\nannounce, “We’re also going to organize the world’s information, but better.”\nOnce companies realize this singular advantage we can expect a land grab of\ngenuine MTPs in the near future.\nA strong MTP also serves as an excellent recruiter for new talent, as well\nas a magnet for retaining top talent—bot h increasingly difficult propos itions\nin today’s hypercompetitive talent marketplace. In addition, an MTP serves as\na stabilizing force during periods of random growth and enables organizations\nto scale with less turbulence.\nThe MTP is not only an effective attractor and retainer for customers and\nemployees but also for the company ecosystem at large (developers, startups,\nhackers, NGOs, governments, suppliers, partners, etc.). As a result, it lowers\nthe acquisition, transaction and retention costs of these stakeholders.\nMTPs don’t operate in isolation. Rather, they create a penumbra around\nthem that influences every part of the organization. A prime early indicator is\nRed Bull, whose MTP is “Giving You Wings.”\nThat’s why, over time, we can expect brands to blend into MTPs, along\nthe way becoming increasingly aspirational. Why? Because aspirational\nbrands create positive feedback loops  in the ExO’s community: customers feel\ngood about the products and are increasingly proud to be part of a larger,\nvirtuous movement. Aspirational branding helps lower costs, improveseffectiveness and speeds learning by leveraging intrinsic, rather than external,\nmotivation.\nThere is also an economic advantage in embracing an MTP. The world is\nfacing many grand challenges, and as Peter Diamandis says, “the world’s\nbiggest problems are the world’s biggest markets.” As a result, over the next\ndecade we expect even shareholders to incorporate MTPs into their stock\nportfolio strategies.\nAs an analog to MTPs, we also see a worldwide increase in social\nenterprises. A study by the G8 in 2013 estimates there are 688,000 social\nenterprises, generating $270 billion annually. These organizations come in\nmany forms (Benefit or B Corporations, Triple Bottom Line, L3Cs, the\nConscious Capital movement, the Slow Money movement) and leverage their\nMTPs to integrate social and environmental issues—as well as profits—into\ntheir business processes. This trend started with the rise of corporate social\nresponsibility (CSR) programs in organizations. In 2012, 57 percent of the\nFortune 500 published a CSR report—double the number from the previous\nyear. The difference is that CSR initiatives are add-ons to most companies’\ncore business; for social enterprises, CSR initiatives are the core business.\nMartin Seligman, a leading expert on positive psychology, differentiates\nbetween three states of happiness: the pleasurable life (hedonistic,\nsuperficial), the good life (family and friends) and the meaningful life (finding\npurpose, transcending ego, working toward a higher good). Research shows\nthat Millennials—those born between 1984 and 2002—a re showing an\norientation towards seeking meaning and purpose in their lives. Worldwide,\nthey are becoming increasingly aspirational and, as such, will be drawn as\ncustomers, employees and investors to equally aspirational organizations—\nthat is, to companies that have MTPs and live up to their tenets. In fact, we\nexpect to see individuals coming up with their own MTPs, which will\njuxtapose, ove rlap and symbiotically exist with the organization’s MTP.According to the United Nations, extreme pove rty has decreased 80\npercent over the last thirty years, including among a majority of the five\nbillion people who will be online by 2020. We predict they’ll all be climbing\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in search of Self-Actualization.

        "name": "Staff on Demand",
        "contents": "Staff on Demand\nIn a 2012 white paper for the Aspen Institute, Michael Chui, a partner at\nthe McKinsey Global Institute, described employment theory in the 20\ncentury as follows:\nThe best way to harness human talent is through full-time,\nexclusive employment relationships where people are paid for\nthe amount of time they spend at a common location. They should\nbe organized in stable hierarchies where they are evaluated\nprimarily through the judgment of their superiors, and what and\nhow they do their jobs is prescribed.\nChui then proceeds to dismantle every phrase in that paragraph to show\nhow fundamentally out of date that theory has become in little more than athdecade. Literally none  of it applies today.\nFor any ExO, having Staff on Demand is a necessary characteristic for\nspeed, functionality and flexibility in a fast-changing world. Leveraging\npersonnel outside the base organization is key to creating and running a\nsuccessful ExO. The fact is, no matter how talented your employees, chances\nare that most of them are becoming obsolete and uncompetitive right before\nyour eyes.\nAs John Seely Brown has noted, the half-life of a learned skill used to be\nabout thirty years. Today it’s down to about five years. In his recent book , The\nStartup of You, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman notes that individuals will\nincreasingly learn to manage themselves as companies, with brand\nmanagement (MTP!), and marketing and sales functions all brought down to\nthe individual. Similarly, Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in\nEconomics in 1991, noted that enterprises are more like families than\nindustries, and that corporations are more of a sociological construct than an\neconomic one.\nFor any company today, having a permanent, full-time workforce is fraught\nwith growing peril as employees fail to keep their skills up to date, resulting\nin personnel in need of greater management. In our fast-changing global and\nInternet-driven marketplace, increasingly desperate organizations are turning\nto external and temporary workforces to fill their expertise gaps. For\nexample, in an effort to keep the overall skills of the organization fresh, AMP,\nAustralia’s largest insurance company, requires that half its 2,600- strong IT\ndepartment be made up of contractors. According to Annalie Killian, a global\nexecutive at AMP, such a requirement is not just helpful; in this day and age,\nit’s mandatory.While maintaining permanent staff is likely to remain more important in\ncertain equipment- and capital-intensive industries such as shipping, mining\nor construction, in any information-enabled business a large internal staff\nseems increasingly unnecessary, counterproductive and expensive. And the\nold argument that freelancers and contractors only increase the bureaucracy\nneeded to manage them quickly falls away too: thanks to the Internet, the cost\nof finding and tracking outside staff drops almost to zero. In addition, due to\nthe rapid rise in the number of Internet users, the volume and quality of\nfreelancers has gone up dramatically in the last ten years.\nGigwalk, which relies on half a million smart-phone-enabled workers,\noffers an example of how this new world of employment works. When\nProctor and Gamble needs to know how and where its merchandise is being\nplaced on Walmart shelves around the world, it can use Gigwalk’s platform to\ninstantly deploy thousands of people who are paid a few dollars to walk into\nWalmart and check the shelves. Results come in within an hour.\nStaff-on-demand initiatives similar to Gigwalk are springing up\neverywhere: oDesk, Roamler, Elance, TaskRabbit and Amazon’s venerable\nMechanical Turk are platforms where all levels of work, including highly\nskilled labor, can be outsourced. These companies, which represent just the\nfirst wave of this new business model, optimize the concept of paying for\nperformance to lower customer risk.\nFor talented workers, working on and getting paid for multiple projects is a\nparticularly welcome oppor tunity. But there’s another angle as well: an\nincrease in the diversity of ideas. The data science company Kaggle, for\nexample, offers a platform that hosts private and public algorithm contests in\nwhich more than 185,000 data scientists around the world vie for prizes and\nrecognition. In 2011, Insurance giant Allstate, with forty of the best actuariesand data scientists money could buy, wanted to see if its claims algorithm\ncould be improved upon, so it ran a contest on Kaggle.\nIt turned out that the Allstate algorithm, which has been carefully\noptimized for over six decades, was bested within three days by 107\ncompeting teams. Three months later, when the contest ended, Allstate’s\noriginal algorithm had been improved 271 pe rcent. And while the prize set the\ncompany back $10,000, t he resulting cost savings due to better algorithms was\nestimated to be in the tens of millions annually. Quite an interesting ROI.\nIn fact, in every one of Kaggle’s 150 contests to date, external data\nscientists have beaten the internal algorithms, often by a wide margin. And in\nmost cases outsiders (non-experts) have beaten the experts in a particular\ndomain, which shows the pow er of fresh thinking and diverse perspectives.\nIn years past, having a large workforce differentiated your enterprise and\nallowed it to accomplish more. Today, that same large workforce can become\nan anchor that reduces maneuverability and slows you down. Moreover,\ntraditional industries have great difficulty attracting on-demand high-skill\nworkers such as data scientists because the available positions are perceived\nas being low in terms of oppor tunity and high in terms of bureaucratic\nobstacles. A study commissioned by Deloitte found that 98 percent of recent\ndata science graduates went to work for Google, Facebook , LinkedIn or\nvarious startups. That doesn’t leave much talent left over for everybody  else.\nThat said, even Google’s workforce of 50,000 very smart employees\npales in comparison to the collective intelligence of the 2.4 billion people\nonline today. We have no doubt that the extraordinary capabilities of this\nmassive collection of intellectual capital will eventually emerge. In the words\nof Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired magazine:\nThe reality is that most of the world’s smartest people don’t have\nthe right credentials. They don’t speak the right language. Theydidn’t grow up in the right country. They didn’t go to the right\nuniversity. They don’t know about you and you don’t know about\nthem. They’re not available, and they already have a job.\nAs we conducted research for this book , it quickly became apparent how\neasy it is to outsource anything and everything. In fact, Timothy Ferris, author\nof the bestselling 4-Hour Workweek, has pioneered many new ideas around\nthis topic.\nA firm called Advisory Board Architects (ABA) presents a fascinating\nexample of how to take the Staff-on-Demand concept to a whole new level.\nABA noticed two issues with company boards: First, as Jaime Grego-Mayer,\na partner at ABA, notes, “95 percent of all boards are simply not managed,”\nsince most of a CEO’s attention goes to managing the company. Second,\nremoving a non-performing board member can be a delicate and political\nmatter; because it’s embarrassing for the CEO, it usually doesn’t happen.\nABA offers companies a human resources department for boards, allowing\nCEOs to outsource the management and tracking of the company board to the\nfirm. ABA establishes metrics for each board member (for example, three\nphone calls per month to open doors) and then tracks those metrics. If a board\nmember is not performing, and a difficult conversation is needed to push that\nmember out, ABA handles it, relieving pressure on the CEO.\nIn 2010, the world had 1.2 billion people online globally. By 2020, that\nnumber will reach five billion. Nearly three billion more people and their\nbrains will be available to work via smartphones, tablets or at Internet cafes.\nThe capabilities that will be unleashed are beyond imagination. Against this\nonslaught, what traditional organization, bogged down with permanent, full-\ntime employees, can endure?",

Now almost 55,000 members strong, this community has been\nable to design and build a drone that is very similar to the Predator drone\nused by the U.S. military (in fact, the DIY drone features 98 percent of the\nPredator’s functionality).But there’s one major difference: A Predator costs $4 million. The DIY\ndrone costs just $300.\nGranted, a great deal of that 2 percent difference in performance can be\nattributed to the weapons systems…bu t still, how is this possible?\nIt’s possible because Anderson has tapped into a large group of\npassionate enthusiasts who contribute time and expertise. “If you build\ncommunities and you do things in public,” he says, “you don’t have to find the\nright people, they find you.”\nThroughout human history, communities started off as geographically\nbased (tribes), became ideological (e.g., religions) and then transitioned into\ncivic administrations (monarchies and nation-states). Today, however, the\nInternet is producing trait-based communities that share intent, belief,\nresources, preferences, needs, risks and other characteristics, none of which\ndepend on physical proximity. For an organization or enterprise, its\n“community” is made up of core team members, alumni (former team\nmembers), partners, vendors, customers, users and fans. The “crowd” can be\nthought of as everyone outside those core layers.\nIt is important to note that an Exponential Organization interacting with its\ncommunity is not simply a transaction. True community occurs when peer-to-\npeer engagement occurs. The more open the community, though, the more\ntraditional and best-practice-oriented the leadership model has to be. As\nAnderson states: “At the top of every one of these communities is a\nbenevolent dictator.” You need strong leadership to manage the community,\nbecause although there are no employees, people still have responsibilities\nand need to be held accountable for their performances.Typically, there are three steps to building a community around an ExO:\nUse the MTP to attract and engage  early members. The MTP serves as\na gravitational force that attracts constituents into its orbit. Tesla,\nBurning Man, TED, Singularity University and GitHub are good\nexamples of communities whose members share common passions.\nNurture the community. Anderson spends three hours every morning\nattending to the DIY Drones community. Elements of nurturing include\nlistening and giving back. DIY Drones blueprints were open sourced and\navailable from day one, which was fine, but it turned out that the\nmembers really wanted DIY Drone Kits. So Anderson provided them.\n(The same DIY kit demand is occurring in the DIY biotech community).\nSmart move. “Unlike digital marketing, where ROI is sustained almost as\nsoon as spending happens, communities are a long-term investment that\nis significantly more strategic,” says social business thought leader Dion\nHinchcliffe. “Additionally, communities with CxO participation are far\nmore likely to be best-in-class.”\nCreate a platform to automate peer-to-peer engage ment. GitHub, for\nexample, has its members rate and review other members’ code. Airbnb\nhosts and users fill out evaluation forms; taxi disrupters Uber, Lyft and\nSidecar encourage clients and drivers to rate one another; and the news\nplatform Reddit invites users to vote on stories. In 2013, Reddit, which\nhas just fifty-one employees, most of whom manage the platform, saw\n731 million unique visitors cast 6.7 billion votes on 41 million stories.\nTalk about a platform…(More on this later.)\nTony Hsieh, CEO of Las Vegas-based Zappos , was inspired by the\nBurning Man community to combine both physical and trait-based\ncommunities within his Las Vegas Downtown Project. The project combines\nwork and play in an urban landscape with homes, infrastructure, hacker\nspaces, shops, cafe/theater and art. In addition to the goal of helping to\ntransform the downtown area into the most community-focused large city inthe world, Hsieh aims to create the smartest place on the planet by maximizing\nthe chances of serendipitous learning between Zappos  insiders and outsiders.\nThe result is not only a community built around common passions, but also\naround a common location.\nNote that in early stages, many companies find it easier to join an existing\ncommunity that shares its MTP. The Quantified Self movement, for instance, is\ndrawing together startups engaged in measuring all aspects of the human body .\nExamples of startups offering wearable technology that have banded together\nto form a community include Scanadu, Withings and Fitbit. As each startup\nfinds its path, of course, it is free to create its own community, particularly\nonce its user base is more significant.\nCrowd\nAs mentioned earlier, the crowd is made up of concentric rings of people\noutside the core community. The crowd is harder to reach, but its numbers are\nmuch greater—even a million times greater—and that’s what makes pursuing\nit particularly compelling.\nWhile similar, there is a distinct difference between Crowd and Staff on\nDemand. Staff on Demand is hired for a particular task and usually via a\nplatform like Elance. Staff on Demand is manage d—you tell workers what it\nis they have to do. Crowd, on the other hand, is pull-based. You open up an\nidea, funding oppor tunity or incentive prize…and let people find you.\nExOs can leverage the crowd by harnessing creativity, innovation, validation\nand even funding:Creativity, innov ation and the overall process of generating, developing,\nand communicating new ideas can be accomplished through the use of\ntools and platforms. Some platforms to aid this process include\nIdeaScale, eYeka, Spigit, InnoCentive, SolutionXchange, Crowdtap and\nBrightidea.\nValidation is achieved by obtaining measurable evidence that an\nexperiment, product or service succeeds in meeting pre-determined\nspecifications. Tools such as UserVoice, Unbounce and Google AdWords\ncan accomplish this.\nCrowdfunding is a growing trend to help fund ideas using the web to\nassemble very large numbers of comparatively small investors—thus not\nonly raising capital, but also reflecting the interest of the market. Two\nwell-known examples of crowdfunding companies are Kickstarter and\nIndiegogo. In 2012 there was an estimated $2.8 billion raised via\ncrowdfunding campaigns. By 2015 that number is expected to climb to\n$15 billion. The World Bank predicts crowdfunding to grow to $93\nbillion by 2025.\nIn addition to raising enormous amounts of money for causes and startups,\nsuch platforms are also democratizing access to working capital. Gustin, a\npremium designer jeans company, uses crowdfunding for all of its designs.\nCustomers back specific designs, and when a predetermined monetary goal\nhas been reached, the products are created and shipped to all backers. Gustin\nthus has no product risk or inventory costs.\nAlready, ExOs are leveraging community and crowd for many functions\ntraditionally handled inside the enterprise, including idea generation, funding,\ndesign, distribution, marketing and sales. This shift is powerful and taps into\nwhat university professor and social media guru Clay Shirky calls cognitive\nsurplus. “The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to",

Ten\nyears later, its revenues had jumped 125x  and the company was generating a\nhalf-billion dollars every three days. At the heart of this staggering growth\nwas the PageRank algorithm, which ranks the popu larity of web pages.\n(Google doesn’t gauge which page is better from a human perspective; its\nalgorithms simply respond to the pages that deliver the most clicks.)\nGoogle isn’t alone. Today, the world is pretty much run on algorithms.\nFrom automotive anti-lock braking to Amazon’s recommendation engine; from\ndynamic pricing for airlines to predicting the success of upcoming Hollywood\nblockbusters; from writing news posts to air traffic control; from credit card\nfraud detection to the 2 percent of posts that Facebook  shows a typical user—\nalgorithms are everywhere in modern life. Recently, McKinsey estimated that\nof the seven hundred end-to-end bank processes (opening an account orgetting a car loan, for example), about half can be fully automated. Computers\nare increasingly performing more and more complex tasks.\nThere is even a marketplace called Algorithmia, where companies are\nmatched with algorithms that can potentially make sense of their data. Like\nGitHub (see Chapter Seven), developers can open up their code for others to\nimprove upon.\nIn particular, there are two types of algorithms that are at the frontier of\nthis new world: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\nMachine Learning is the ability to accurately perform new, unseen tasks,\nbuilt on known properties learned from training or historic data, and based on\nprediction. Key open source examples include Hadoop and Cloudera. An\nillustration of Machine Learning comes via Netflix, which in 2006 set out to\nimprove its movie recommendations. Rather than limit the challenge to its in-\nhouse workforce, Netflix launched a $1 million (incentive) competition with a\nstated goal of improving its movie-rating algorithm by 10 percent. The initial\n51,000 contestants, who hailed from 186 countries, received a dataset of one\nhundred million ratings and had five years to achieve the goal. The contest\nended early, in September 2009, when one of the 44,014 valid submissions\nachieved the goal and was awarded the prize.\nDeep Learning is a new and exciting subset of Machine Learning based\non neural net technology. It allows a machine to discover new patterns without\nbeing exposed to any historical or training data. Leading startups in this space\nare DeepMind, bought by Google in early 2014 for $500 million, back when\nDeepMind had just thirteen employees, and Vicarious, funded with investment\nfrom Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Twitter, Baidu, Microsoft\nand Facebook  are also heavily invested in this area. Deep Learning\nalgorithms rely on discovery and self-indexing, and operate in much the same\nway that a baby learns first sounds, then words, then sentences and even\nlanguages. As an example: In June 2012, a team at Google X built a neuralnetwork of 16,000 computer processors with one billion connections. After\nallowing it to browse ten million randomly selected YouTube video\nthumbnails for three days, the network began to recognize cats, without\nactually knowing the concept of “cats.” Importantly, this was without any\nhuman intervention or input.\nIn the two years since, the capabilities of Deep Learning have improved\nconsiderably. Today, in addition to improving speech recognition, creating a\nmore effective search engine (Ray Kurzweil is working on this within\nGoogle) and identifying individual objects, Deep Learning algorithms can\nalso detect particular episodes in videos and even describe them in text, all\nwithout human input. Deep Learning algorithms can even play video games by\nfiguring out the rules of the game and then optimizing performance.\nThink about the implications of this revolutionary breakthrough. The\ntechnology will make most products and services more effective,\npersonalized and efficient. At the same time, many white-collar jobs will be\nimpacted and even disrupted.\nGiven that the 55,000 trucks in UPS’s American fleet make sixteen million\ndeliveries daily, the potential for inefficient routing is enormous. But by\napplying telematics and algorithms, the company saves its drivers eighty-five\nmillion miles a year, resulting in a cost savings of $2.55 billion. Similar\napplications in healthcare, energy and financial services mean that we’re\nentering a world of Algorithms R Us.\nAs far back as 2005, writer and publisher Tim O’Reilly stated that, “Data\nis the new Intel Inside.” And that was when there were just a half-billion\nInternet-connected devices in the world. As we noted in Chapter One, that\nnumber is set to grow to a trillion devices as we prepare to embrace the\nInternet of Things.In the face of that explosion, the need for algorithms has become mission\ncritical. Consider for a moment that the last two years have seen nine times\nmore data created than in the entire history of humanity. Then consider that the\nComputer Sciences Corporation believes that by 2020 we’ll have created a\ntotal 73.5 zettabytes of data—in Stephen Hawking’s phraseology, that’s\nseventy-three followed by twenty-one zeros.\nRemarkably, and often tragically, most companies today are still driven\nalmost solely on the intuitive guesses of their leaders. They may use data to\nguide their thinking, but they are just as likely to fall prey to a long list of self-\ndelusions—everything from a sunk-cost bias to a confirmation bias (see\nbelow for a list of cognitive biases). One reason for Google’s success is that\nit is more ruthlessly data-driven than most other companies, right down to its\nhiring practices.\nIn the same way that today we can no longer handle the complexities of air\ntraffic control or supply chain management without algorithms, almost all the\nbusiness insights and decisions of tomorrow will be data-driven.\nAn analysis by the American Psychological Association of seventeen\nstudies on hiring practices found that a simple algorithm beat intuitive hiring\npractices by more than 25 percent in terms of successful hires. Neil\nJacobstein, an expert in Artificial Intelligence, notes that we use AI and\nalgorithms to mitigate and compensate for many of the following heuristics in\nhuman cognition:\nAnchoring bias: Tendency to rely too heavily, or “anchor,”\non one trait or piece of information when making\ndecisions.\nAvailability bias: Tendency to overestimate the likelihood of\nevents with greater “availability” in memory, which canbe influenced by how recent the memories are or how\nunusual or emotionally charged they may be.\nConfirmation bias: Tendency to search for, interpret, focus\non and remember information in a way that confirms\none’s preconceptions.\nFraming bias: Drawing different conclusions from the same\ninformation, depending on how or by whom that\ninformation is presented.\nOptimism bias: Tendency to be over-optimistic,\noverestimating favorable and pleasing outcomes.\nPlanning fallacy bias: Tendency to overestimate benefits\nand underestimate costs and task-completion times.\nSunk-cost or loss-aversion bias: Disutility of giving up an\nobject is greater than the utility associated with acquiring\nit.\nComplete list of all cognitive biases:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\nJacobstein is fond of pointing out that your neocortex has not had a major\nupgrade in 50,000 years. It is the size, shape and thickness of a dinner napkin.\n“What if,” he asks, “it was the size of a table cloth? Or California?”\nThere is an interesting difference of opinion over how much data should be\nused based on the nature of the market in which the organization operates.\nWhile conventional wisdom says to gather as much data as possible (hence\nthe term Big Data), psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer cautions that in uncertain\nmarkets, it is better to simplify, use heuristics and rely on fewer variables. Instable and predictable markets, on the other hand, he recommends\norganizations “complexify” and use algorithms with more variables.\nOne of the leaders in gleaning insights from massive amounts of data is\nPalantir. Founded in 2004, Palantir builds government, commercial and health\nsoftware solutions that empower organizations to make sense of disparate\ndata. By handling technical problems, Palantir liberates its customers to focus\non solving human ones. The venture capital industry considers Palantir so\nimportant that the company has already received an astounding $900 million\nin total funding, and is valued at 10x that amount.\nMichael Chui notes that many successful companies today had Big Data in\ntheir DNA. We believe it’s just the beginning, and that many more algorithm-\nfocused ExOs will pop up in the coming years, harnessing what Yuri van\nGeest calls the 5P benefits of big data: produc tivity, prevention,\nparticipation, pe rsonalization and prediction.\nTo implement algorithms, ExOs need to follow four steps:\n1. Gather: The algorithmic process starts with harnessing data, which is\ngathered via sensors or humans, or imported from public datasets.\n2. Organize: The next step is to organize the data, a process known as ETL\n(extract, transform and load).\n3. Apply: Once the data is accessible, machine learning tools such as\nHadoop and Pivotal, or even (open source) deep learning algorithms like\nDeepMind, Vicarious and SkyMind, extract insights, identify trends and\ntune new algorithms.\n4. Expos e: The final step is exposing the data, as if it were an open\nplatform. Open data and APIs can be used to enable an ExO’s community\nto develop valuable services, new functionalities and innovation layered\non top of the platform by remixing the ExO’s data with their own.",

As noted above , Tesla owns its\nown factories and Amazon its own warehouses. When the asset in question is\nrare or extremely scarce, then ownership is a better option. But if your asset is\ninformation-based or commoditized at all, then accessing is better than\npossessing.\nWhy Important?

But in the\nlast few years, such techniques have been fully information-enabled,\nelaborated and socialized. Engagement is comprised of digital reputation\nsystems, games and incentive prizes, and provides the opportunity for\nvirtuous, positive feedback loops —which in turn allows for faster growth due\nto more innovative ideas and customer and community loyalty. Companies\nlike Google, Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Yelp, GitHub and Twitter all leverage\ndifferent engagement mechanisms. Nilofer Merchant, author of two book s on\ncollaboration and a professor of management at Santa Clara University,\nreferences Engagement in her book , 11 Rules for Creating Value in the Social\nEra:[Engagement] is a way of enabling collaborative human behavior\n—social behavior—to come into play. The truth is this:\nconnected individuals can now do what once only large\ncentralized organizations could. The effects of which are seen in\nevery Exponential Organizational example. But it’s this\nmanagement truth that requires deeper consideration. Why do\npeople connect together? Based on what kind of purpose? What\nis it that motivates them to act in common interests, not simply\ntheir own? What causes them to trust you enough to want to\ncontribute something of theirs toward a shared goal? So the\nquestion for leaders is how do you enable, foster, organize,\ngalvanize and act on that fundamental human capacity to\ncontribute and work with others?\nKey attributes of Engagement include:\nRanking transparency\nSelf-efficacy (sense of control, agency and impact)\nPeer pressure (social comparison)\nEliciting positive rather than negative emotions to drive long-term\nbehavioral change\nInstant feedback (short feedback cycles)\nClear, authentic rules, goals and rewards (only reward outputs, not\ninputs)\nVirtual currencies or points\nProperly implemented, Engagement creates network effects and positive\nfeedback loops  with extraordinary reach. The biggest impact of engagement\ntechniques is on customers and the entire external ecosystem. However, these\ntechniques can also be used internally with employees to boos t collaboration,\ninnovation and loyalty.For the Millennial generation, gaming is a way of life. Today, more than seven\nhundred million people around the world play online games—159 million in\nthe U.S. alone—and most play for more than an hour each day. The average\nyoung person racks up more than 10,000 hours of gaming by the age of twenty-\none. That’s almost exactly as much time as kids spend in the classroom\nthroughout middle school and high school. Gaming isn’t just something that\nyoung people do, it is a large part of what and who they are.\nThese numbers help explain why AI researchers are using gaming to help\nthem map the human brain. The only problem is that it takes an AI-assisted\nresearcher fifty hours to reconstruct just one neuron in 3D. The brain has 85\nbillion neurons—which means it would take 4,250 bi llion hours to completely\nmap the human brain. That’s 485.2 million years. Rather linear, wouldn’t you\nsay?\nTo solve this problem and speed up the process, EyeWire—which was\nspun out of MIT and launched in December 2012—h as created a game in\nwhich players color 2D pieces to form 3D pieces as they simultaneously\nreconstruct neurons. This very simple task for a very difficult problem has\nalready resulted in 130,000 pe ople from 145 c ountries mapping more than one\nhundred neurons.\nEyeWire illustrates how an ExO can apply game elements and mechanics\nin non-game products and services to create fun and engaging experiences,\nconverting users into loyal players—and in the process accomplish\nextraordinary things. Other games that use this technique include MalariaSpot\n(hunt malaria parasites in real images), GalaxyZoo (classify galaxies\naccording to their shapes) and Foldit (help biochemists combat AIDS and\nother diseases by predicting and producing protein models).\nAs game designer and author Jane McGonigal sees it, “Human beings are\nwired to compete.”Engaging gamers, however, requires more than just throwing a game up on\na website and letting gamers have at it. “Gamification should empower\npeople, not exploit them. It should feel good at the end of the day because you\nmade progress towards something that mattered to you.”\nTo be successful, every gamification initiative should leverage the\nfollowing game techniques:\nDynamics: motivate behavior through scenarios, rules and progression\nMechanics: help achieve goals through teams, competitions, rewards\nand feedback\nCompone nts: track progress through quests, points, levels, badges and\ncollections\nGamification is not only used to tackle challenges and problems with the help\nof a community, it can also be used as a hiring tool. Google is famous for\nusing games to qualify potential hires, and Domino’s Pizza created a video\ngame called Pizza Hero in which the goal is to make the perfect pizza neatly\nand quickly. Customers can create their own pies and then order them, and top\npizza makers are encouraged to apply for jobs.\nAnother use of gamification is to improve a company’s internal culture.\nKarl M. Kapp researched this topic in his book , The Gamification of\nLearning and Instruction Fieldbook : Ideas Into Practice. One example he\ncites is that of Pep Boys, a large car repair and maintenance retail store that\nhas over seven hundred locations in thirty-five states and generates $2 billion\neach year. Despite its profit margins, the company found that it suffered from\nmany safety-related incidents and injuries each year, many of them a result of\nhuman error. It also found that theft was becoming an increasing problem. To\nincrease awareness of the issues, Pep Boys implemented a platform calledAxonify, which used a quiz to educate employees about specific incidents.\nCorrect answers earned the employees prizes; incorrect answers resulted in\nadditional information and testing until the material was fully mastered. The\nplatform achieved a voluntary participation rate of over 95 percent, and even\nas the number of stores and employees increased over time, safety incidents\nand claim counts fell more than 45 percent, and theft and human errors\ndroppe d 55 percent. As safety became a top focus at Pep Boys, its culture\ncompletely shifted.\nGamification initiatives can be created from the ground up (as illustrated\nby EyeWire), but there are also many startups and companies providing\nservices that an organization can simply adopt and leverage, just as Pep Boys\ndid with Axonify. The Gamification Company provides a list with more than\nninety examples, including Badgeville, Bunchball, Dopamine and Comarch.\nOrganizations can also use work.com (a Salesforce company), in which\ngamification is fully integrated, or Keas, which was specifically created to\nimprove employee wellness.\nIncentive competitions are another form of engagement that has been recently\npopu larized by the X Prize Foundation and others. This engagement technique\nis typically used to find promising people in the crowd and move them into\nthe community. Competitions are also used to challenge, leverage and\nmotivate the community in order to solicit potentially radical breakthrough\nideas. For Peter Diamandis, it all started with the Ansari X Prize, which\nrewarded $10 million to the first non-government organization to launch a\nreusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. Twenty-six\nteams from around the world participated, and contestants included everyone\nfrom hobby ists to large-corporation-backed teams. In November 2004,\nMojave Aerospace Ventures won the prize with its SpaceShipOne spacecraft.Virgin Galactic is currently using the successors to this design to enable\ncommercial space flight, which will cost $250,000 a ticket and is planned for\nthe end of 2014.\nAfter the success of the Ansari X Prize, more X Prizes were created. One\nof X Prize’s current offerings is the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which will\naward $10 million to the first team whose handheld medical diagnostic\ndevice outperforms ten board-certified physicians. Currently, twenty-one\nteams are competing for the grand prize. The recently launched X Prize\nspinoff HeroX takes this model even further, allowing companies to create\ntheir own challenges through the HeroX platform to solve local and global\nchallenges.\nAn incentive prize creates a clear, measurable and objective goal, and\noffers a cash purse for the first team to reach that objective. The advantage\nsuch competitions offers is their ability to deliver huge leverage and\nefficiency. Incentive prizes are also tools that can be used by individuals,\nstartups, governments, and medium and large corporations, but they are unique\nin that they allow small teams or lone innovators to launch or transform\nindustries. By tapping into the deep-rooted human desire to compete, these\ncompetitions push teams to deliver their very best work. In most cases,\nincentive competitions have stretch goals embedded within them as well,\nmeaning they require breakthrough thinking and revolutionary products to win.\nPerhaps the most important side effect of incentive competition is the\nperipheral innovation it creates as numerous competitors race towards a\ncommon goal. Such innovations can galvanize a company or an entire industry,\nspurring it forward at an unprecedented pace. From 2008 to 2011, Yuri van\nGeest and Vodafone Netherlands (later on, Vodafone Group) created and ran\nthe world’s largest mobile Internet startup contest, Vodafone Mobile Clicks,\nwith prizes exceeding $300,000.  The competition launched in the Netherlands\nand quickly grew to include a total of seven European countries. MobileClicks enabled Vodafone to engage not only with more than 900 mobile\nInternet startups, but also with the local mobile community in each of those\ncountries. In the process, what began as an external competition funneled into\nan internal interface that provided Vodafone with oppor tunities to fund and\nacquire ideas, identify talent and acquire candidates. Vodafone’s “contest”\nbecame a form of corporate venture capital, which morphed successfully into\nthe thriving Startupboot camp (SBC) startup incubator/accelerator program\nacross Europe.\nIncentive competitions are hardly new—after all, Charles Lindberg’s solo\nnonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 was in pursuit of just such a\nprize; in fact, his biography inspired Peter Diamandis to create the X Prize.\nAnother well-known incentive program designed to increase engagement is\nthe longstanding “Employee of the Month” program. Until recently, however,\nincentive programs have rarely been used to motivate creativity and\nproductivity within communities and crowds.\nAnother positive side effect of engagement, particularly when it comes to\ngamification, is training. The complexity of some of today’s games provides\nan excellent education in leadership and teamwork skills. In fact, Joi Ito has\nobserved that becoming an effective World of Warcraft guild master is\ntantamount to a total-immersion course in leadership.\nIndeed, what might seem like the least serious tool in a company’s user\nand employee engagement program often proves to be one of its most\npowerful in terms of finding and training the individuals it needs to reach the\nnext level.\nAlthough a comparatively minor issue as far as traditional enterprises are\nconcerned, engagement proves to be critical for ExOs. It is a key element for\nscaling the organization into the community and crowd and for creatingexternal network effects. No matter how promising its product or premise,\nunless an ExO is able to optimize the engagement of its community and crowd,\nit will wither and fade.\nWhy Important? Dependencies or Prerequisites\n• Increases loyalty\n• Amplifies ideation\n• Converts crowd to\ncommunity\n• Leverages marketing\n• Enables play and\nlearning\n• Provides digital\nfeedback loop w ith users• MTP\n• Clear, fair and consistent rules\nwithout conflicts of interest\nPassion and Purpose. We began this chapter by essentially asking two\nquestions: What gives an organization meaning? What compels employees,\ncustomers and even members of the general public to devote themselves to the\nsuccess of that enterprise? These questions become even more vital when\ndiscussing Exponential Organizations, given that their extraordinary rates of\ngrowth, combined with a heavy dependence on their communities to help them\nrealize their visions, demands a level of unprecedented commitment from a\nbroader set of stakeholders—individuals who traditionally have had only a\ntenuous connection to the enterprise.\nAlthough such commitment is often found with music groups and sports\nteams, it is seldom seen in the corporate world. There are, however, a few\ncorporate rock stars, the most famous of which is Apple. Apple’s army of\nmillions of true believers, who line up to buy its products, create blogs about\nthe company and products, place Apple stickers in the back windows of cars,and vociferously defend the company against heretics and apostates, is a\nparadigmatic example of a lively, complex and powerful corporate\ncommunity.\nObviously, creating such a community requires a great product and a\ncompelling vision. But it also demands a fair amount of time. It took eight\nyears after the introduction of the Macintosh for Apple Computer to become a\nphenomenon, and another sixteen years for the company to reach its status as a\ncultural icon.\nExponential Organizations don’t have that amount of time. Nor are they\nlikely to have a charismatic leader like Steve Jobs. Instead, they must move\nquickly and systematically, using proven techniques and tools. In this chapter\nwe’ve provided both: the MTP to elicit the passionate involvement of all\nstakeholders in a crusade to achieve a compelling larger vision; and the\ncomponents of SCALE to build and engage the Community & Crowd, to use\nStaff on Demand and Leveraged Assets, and to leverage Algorithms.\nAre these attributes perfect substitutes for charisma and genius? No. But they\nare a lot more available and much less subject to chance. They are also much\nmore manageable. Best of all, the combination of MTP and SCALE can be\napplied to any organization, small or large.\nNow that we have covered the external attributes of an ExO, in the next\nchapter we will examine the internal attributes to see how an organization\nmanages the chaos and keeps from breaking apart while running at such a high\nspeed.\nKey TakeawaysExponential Organizations have a Massive\nTransformative Purpose (MTP)\nBrands will start morphing into MTPs\nExOs scale outside their organizational\nboundaries by leveraging or accessing people,\nassets and platforms to maximize flexibility,\nspeed, agility and learning.\nExOs leverage five externalities (SCALE) to\nachieve performance gains:\nStaff on Demand\nCommunity & Crowd\nAlgorithms\nLeveraged Assets\nEngagementCHAPTER FOUR\nInside the Exponential Organization\nThe sheer output to be processed when SCALE elements are leveraged\nrequires that the internal control mechanisms of an ExO be managed carefully\nand efficiently. For example, an X Prize generates hundreds of ideas that need\nto be evaluated, catalogued, ranked and prioritized. With exponential output,\nthe internal organization needs to be extremely robust, precise and properly\ntuned to process all the inputs. As a result, Exponential Organizations are far\nmore than how they appear to the outside world, or how they behave with\ncustomers, communities and other stakeholders. They also have distinctly\ndifferent internal operations that encompass everything from their business\nphilosophies to how employees interact with one another, how they measure\ntheir performance (and what they value in that performance), and even their\nattitudes toward risk—in fact, especially their attitudes toward risk.\nAnd just as the external attributes of the Exponential Organization can be\nencompassed with the acronym SCALE, so too can an ExO’s internal\nmechanisms be expressed with the acronym IDEAS.\nInterfaces\nDashboards\nExperimentation\nAutonomy",

A regional hub would then tally the results for multiple stores a few days\nlater. Several weeks after that, a buyer at the head office would look over the\ntotals and determine how many boxes of Pampers the company needed to\norder for its next bulk purchase.\nWalmart blew this model apart—and in the process revolutionized\nretailing—by  launching its own geostationary satellite and then tracking\ninventory and supply chain transfers in real time. It crushed the competition by\nconsistently outperforming other chains by 15 percent—a staggering\ncompetitive margin in retail. Sears and Kmart never fully recovered.\nThere has always been a tension in business created by the need to\nbalance instrumentation and data collection versus running the company and\ngetting things done. Collecting internal progress statistics takes time, effort\nand expensive IT. That’s why results were usually tracked annually or, at best,\nquarterly.\nToday’s startups (as well as more mature enterprises) are leveraging\nwireless broadband, the Internet, sensors and the cloud to track this same data\nin real time. Will Henshall, founder and CEO of the fascinating startup\nfocus@will, which streams anti-distraction music and sounds to help users\nfocus, has instrumented his business almost completely. Embedded into his\noperations are the following metrics, which he tracks in real time:\nTotal users\nNew guests within last day\nTotal number of Personal Users\nNew Personal User registrations within last day\nPercentage of New Personal Users vs. new Guests within last day\nTotal Pro Subscribers\nNew Pro Subscribers within last dayPercentage of New Pro Subscribers vs. new Personal Users within last\nday\nTotal cash receipts\nCash receipts within last 30 da ys\nCash receipts within last day\nTo a corporate executive from just twenty years ago this would be an\nastounding list of measurements—almost beyond imagination. But the quality\nof this list is even more impressive than its quantity. It offers metrics about\ncustomer behavior every bit the equal of information stored in the head of an\nold-time storekeeper about the needs and wants of each of his small-town\npatrons—bu t on a global scale. And the amount of information stored will\nonly grow each year, even as the Big Data analytics to process it improve\nover time.\nAnd there’s more. Today we are seeing a different approach to gathering\ndata than in the past. Traditional vanity metrics (stats such as the number of\nvisitors or mobile app downloads) are being replaced by real value metrics\nincluding repeat usage, retention percentage, monetization and Net Promoter\nScore (NPS). This emergent focus on real value KPIs is being built into the\npopu lar new Lean St artup movement (see Experimentation).\nEven as the instrumenting of businesses accelerates, a similar\ntransformation is also taking place at the level of individual employee and\nteam performance tracking. The dreaded annual performance review is\ndemotivating for most employees, and is especially so for high achievers\nbecause of the long delay between accomplishment and recognition. During\nthat interval, top employees are at risk of becoming frustrated, bored, and\nmoving on—costing fast-growth companies the employees they can least\nafford to lose.In response, many ExOs are adopting the Objectives and Key Results\n(OKR) method. Invented at Intel by CEO Andy Grove and brought to Google\nby venture capitalist John Doerr in 1999, OKR tracks individual, team and\ncompany goals and outcomes in an open and transparent way. In High Output\nManage ment, Grove’s highly regarded manual, he introduced OKRs as the\nanswer to two simple questions:\n1. Where do I want to go? (Objectives)\n2. How will I know I’m getting there? (Key Results to ensure progress is\nmade)\nIn addition to Intel and Google, other fast-growth companies using the\nsystem include LinkedIn, Zynga, Oracle, Twitter and Facebook .\nIn operation, an OKR program, as its name suggests, operates along two\ntracks. An Objective, for example, might be to “Increase sales by 25 percent,”\nalong with “Form two strategic partnerships” and “Run AdWords campaign”\nas the desired Key Results. OKRs are about focus, simplicity, short(er)\nfeedback cycles, and openness. As a result, insights and improvements are\neasier to see and implement. In contrast, complexity, secrecy and broad goals\ntend to impede progress, often leading to unintended consequences. As Larry\nKeeley, president and co-founder of the innovation strategy firm Doblin\nGroup, says, “The truth is there are about 65 different metrics for innovation.\nNo company needs all 65. You need half a dozen. You need to pick the right\nhalf dozen contextually for whatever it is you’re trying to achieve\nstrategically.”\nSome characteristics of OKRs:\nKPIs are determined top-down, while OKRs are determined bot tom-up.Objectives are the dream; Key Results are the success criteria (i.e., a\nway to measure incremental progress towards the objective).\nObjectives are qualitative and Key Results are quantitative. OKRs are\nnot the same as employee evaluations. OKRs are about the company’s\ngoals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance\nevaluations—which are entirely about evaluating how an employee\nperformed in a given period—a re independent of OKRs.\nObjectives are ambitious and should feel uncomfortable.\n[In general, up to five objectives and four key results per initiative are\noptimal, and key results should see an achievement rate of 60 to 70\npercent; if they don’t, the bar has been set too low.]\nExOs have more than taken this technique to heart. Many are now\nimplementing high-frequency OKRs—that is, a target per week, month or\nquarter for each individual or team within a company.\nScientific results in neuroscience, gamification and behavioral economics\nhave shown the importance of both specificity and frequent feedback in\ndriving behavioral change and, ultimately, having an impact. Specificity and\nrapid feedback cycles energize, motivate and drive company morale and\nculture. As a result, a number of services, including OKR Hub, Cascade,\nTeamly and 7Geese, have been formed to help businesses track these\nmeasures.\nThat said, there is still a long way to go, especially beyond the world of\nhot startups, and this is true of even the world’s high tech centers. Fabio\nTroiani, managing director of Business Integration Partners, a global\nconsultancy based in Italy, obs erves that OKRs are still unique even to Silicon\nValley. He reports that of the hundred large corporations in Europe and South\nAmerica with which he’s familiar, none use OKRs.Meanwhile, dashboards of value metrics, used in conjunction with OKRs, are\nbecoming the de facto standard for measuring ExOs—everything from the\ncompany as a whole to individual teams and employees. At Google, for\nexample, all OKRs are completely transparent and public within the company.\nFurthermore, younger-generation employees have experienced different\nconditioning in terms of measurements and feedback loops  than have older\ngenerations. For example, embedded within the highly popu lar game of World\nof Warcraft are dashboards similar to OKRs and Lean metrics with short\nfeedback cycles.\nA good analogy for the benefit of fast-cycle OKRs is mobile phones. Over\nthe last fifteen years, the instant email and always-on connectivity provided\nby mobile phones has drastically improved decision-making speed and\nconversation cycle times. OKRs do the same for organizations.\nWhy are dashboards key for ExOs? Because growing at a rapid pace\nrequires that instrumentation of the business, individual and team assessments\nbe integrated and carried out in real time, not least because small mistakes\ncan grow very big very fast. Without both functions in place, a company is\nliable to drift back to its earlier focus on “vanity” metrics and lose attention\nor have misguided KPIs for teams. Or both.\nAs mentioned at the start of the chapter, tight control frameworks are\ncritical to managing hyper growth. Real time dashboards and OKRs are key\nelements of that control framework.\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Track critical growth drivers in\nreal time\n• OKRs create control framework\nto manage fast growth• Real time metrics\ntracked, gathered and\nanalyzed\n• OKRs implemented",

It seduces smart people into thinking they\ncan’t lose.”In a recent commencement address at Singapore Management University,\nJohn Seely Brown made the compelling point that all corporate architectures\nare set up to withstand risk and change. Furthermore, he said, all corporate\nplanning efforts attempt to scale efficiency and predictability, meaning they\nwork to create static—or at least controlled-growth—environments in the\nbelief that they will reduce risk.\nBut in today’s fast-changing world, Seely Brown continued, just the\noppos ite is true. Mark Zuckerberg agrees, noting, “The biggest risk is not\ntaking any risk.” Constant experimentation and process iteration are now the\nonly ways to reduce risk. Large numbers of bottom-up ideas, properly\nfiltered, always trump top-down thinking, no matter the industry or\norganization. Seely Brown and Hagel call this “scalable learning,” and given\nthe growth rates of ExOs, it is their only possible strategy. In the best cases,\nExOs feature both—that is, ideas are developed bottom-up and get\nacceptance/ratification/support from the top. In the end, the best ideas win,\nregardless of who propos ed them.\nIn an effort to kick-start this kind of thinking, Adobe  Systems recently\nlaunched the KickStart Innovation Workshop. Participating employees receive\na red box containing a step-by-step startup guide and a pre-paid credit card\nwith $1,000 in seed money, and are given forty-five days to experiment with\nand validate innovative ideas. Although they have access to coaching from\nsome of the company’s top innovators, the rest is up to them. In 2013, nine\nhundred of Adobe ’s 11,000 employees participated in the workshop. Not only\ndoes Adobe ’s approach stimulate experimentation, but it also establishes a\nmeasurable funnel by which promising ideas and concepts can be identified\nand pursued in a systemic and comparable way.\nMany other companies are also exploring experimentation—not just in\nskunkworks, but also on core processes. It is not, however, a totally new\nconcept. The Japanese have long followed the practice of kaizen: constantimprovement as a fundamental process management technique. The only\ndifference between scalable learning and kaizen is the use of new and more\nadvanced offline and online data-driven tools to test assumptions of customer\ngroups, use cases and solutions.\nApple used a kind of kaizen to launch its first retail store, which was\nconsidered a highly risky move at the time. After bringing Millard Drexler,\nCEO of Gap Inc., onto its board, Apple then hired Ron Johnson (who as vice\npresident of merchandising made his name elevating Target’s image above\nthat of a high-end Kmart) to manage the new retail operations. With their\ncollective knowledge, the two men prototyped a store, then tested and\nredesigned it based on customer data and feedback. Apple kept iterating until\nit had enough validation to roll out its first Apple Store in northern Virginia on\nMay 15, 2001. Once the concept became successful, Apple scaled it\naggressively; the company currently has 425 r etail stores in sixteen countries.\nThis technique is popu larly known as the Lean Startup movement, which\nwas created by Eric Ries and Steve Blank and is based on Ries’s book  of the\nsame name. The Lean Startup philosophy (also known as the Lean Launchpad)\nis in turn based upon Toyota’s “lean manufacturing” principles, first\nestablished a half-century ago, in which the elimination of wasteful processes\nis paramount. (Sample principle: “Eliminate all expenses with any goal other\nthan the creation of value for the end customer.”)The Lean Startup concept was also given impetus by Steve Blank’s book ,\nThe Four Steps to the Epiphan y, which focuses on customer development.\n(Sample concept: “We don’t know what the customer wants until assumptions\nare validated.”) The most important message of the Lean Startup movement is\nto “Fail fast and fail often, while eliminating waste.” Its approach can be\nsummarized as a new, scientific, data-driven, iterative, and highly customer-\ndriven approach to practical innovation that is used by startups, mid-marketcompanies, corporations and even governments. To illustrate how this credo\ncan have such a positive impact on a company, compare it to the traditional\nmethod of  product development, also known as the waterfall model.\nAs mentioned in Chapter Two, the traditional waterfall approach to\nproduct development is a linear process (most often referred to as NPD, for\nNew Product Development) that uses sequential steps such as idea generation,\nscreening, product design, development and commercialization. This process\nnot only burns up a great deal of precious time but, more importantly,\nincreasingly results in new products that don’t fit—or, because the market is\nchanging so quickly, no longer fit—the needs of the customer, culminating in a\nproduct no one wants. Inevitably, even more time and money is spent adapting\nthe product to fit the customer, a process that once again takes too long as the\nmarket moves on.\nIn the end, of course, the product fails. In sum, NPD has become a process\nin which thinking and doing are separated for a long time period and where\ndata-driven and behavioral customer feedback is delivered too late in the\ndevelopment process. As Nassim Taleb explains, “Knowledge gives you a\nlittle bit of an edge, but tinkering (trial and error) is the equivalent of 1,000 I Q\npoints. It is tinkering that allowed the Industrial Revolution.”\nBy comparison, consider the same scenario using the Lean Startup\nmethod:\nThe company first researches the needs of the customer, then conducts an\nexperiment to see if a propos ed product matches those needs. By relying on\nquantitative and qualitative data, a company forms a conclusion based on a\nseries of well-considered questions:\nDoes a product fit the need of the customer?\nHow did a customer solve a problem or need in the past?\nWhat are the current costs created by the customer problem?Should we adapt or change our course?\nAre we ready to scale?\nThis process of constant learning can be accomplished in just a couple of\nweeks or months, at minimal cost. Best of all, it usually becomes clear early\non if a product is doom ed to failure. A good way of looking at this is that\nwhen you move from point A to point B, you can then see point C. But you\ncan’t see point C from point A. Iteration/experimentation is the only way.\nAs Eric Ries explains, “The modern rule of competition is whoever learns\nfastest, wins.” Most digital markets are winner-takes-all markets due to\nnetwork effects. This makes a culture of continuous experimentation even\nmore important.\nThe Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship uses a Lean Startup\nprocess for corporate innovation that is similar to the one used at Adobe . It’s\ncalled the 5x5x5x5 method (5). Five corporate teams with five\ncomplementary team members compete for five weeks (one to two days a\nweek), spending no more than $5,000 to produce one innovation. The budget\nis ideal for testing assumptions with real customers related to the customer\ngroup, customer problem (use case), and solution (innovation concept) using\ndifferent offline and online methods.\nAfter five weeks, each team presents its output, which is a combination of\nconcept, competitive analysis, business model canvas and validated learning\nbased on different experiments or Minimal Viable Products (MVPs). In short,\nit is a data-driven, scientific, problem-solution fit and product-market fit for\nthe innovative idea that maximizes learning and speeds up the product\ndevelopment process—bot h key requirements for a rapidly changing world.\nNot bad for little more than one month’s work.\nMaria Mujica, who heads up the two-year-old innovation unit Fly Garage\nfor Mondelez International, a confectionery company, uses Experimentation to4run several-day “Garages” to create new brand engagements. Groups of free\nthinkers from inside and outside the organization are invited to participate in a\nno-boundary environment. The following steps constitute a “Garage”\nexperience:\nDetox by disconnecting and unplugging from everything\nEmpathize and immerse so as to connect with the oppor tunity\nBoil ideas down to a creative brief (brief then transcribed onto a T-shirt\nthat’s worn)\nAgitate to drive ideation and mix/shake up solutions\nPrototype rapidly to enable a fast user experience\nFascinating outcomes have resulted from Garages, including the “Traffic\nKaraoke in Bogota” and a vending machine where users pay with hunger\n(which is measured by a swallowed sensor). Fly Garage is successfully\nbalancing corporate procedural repeatability with highly creative outcomes—\na holy grail for any organization. Mujica has also mastered another\ntraditionally difficult balance: top-down direction with bottom-up creativity\nand little or no cultural tension.\nA final and critical pre-requisite for experimentation is a willingness to fail.\nThirty years ago, Regis McKenna, a Silicon Valley marketing pioneer, was the\nfirst to note that whatever its reputation for success, the Valley was in fact\nbuilt on failure—or more precisely, a willingness to accept and even reward\n“good”  failure.\nUnfortunately, within the traditional corporate environment, failure more\noften than not still results in career-level consequences due to long lead times\nand large investments. This, of course, reduces risk appetite. At the same\ntime, sunk-cost bias (the momentum that attaches to projects solely because ofthe money already invested) also kicks in. Before long, a company can find\nitself spending even more money launching a doom ed product despite clear\ndata that it will fail. Remember the Iridium mobile phones case? The Navteq–\nWaze case? In addition, consider the well-known NASA motto: “Failure is\nnot an option.” Although noble and inspiring, it was ultimately a death knell\nfor exploration. When failure is not an option, you end up with safe,\nincremental innovation, with no radical breakthroughs or disruptive\ninnovations.\nBy integrating experimentation as a core value and adopting approaches\nlike Lean Startup, enterprise failures—while still accepted as an inevitable\npart of risk—can be quick, relatively painless and insightful. Google, for\nexample, is particularly good at experimentation: If a product is not meeting\nits goals, and resources could be better leveraged elsewhere, the product is\nshut down. Recriminations are limited, the company quickly moves on and the\nemployees involved never experience career-limiting consequences.\nSome corporations have even taken to celebrating failure in order to\ncounteract what they see as a cultural resistance among their employees to the\nvery idea of failure. For example, the Procter & Gamble Heroic Failure\naward honors the employee or team with the biggest failure that delivered the\ngreatest insight. Similarly, Tata offers an annual Dare To Try award, which\nrecognizes managers who took the biggest risk. In 2013 alone, the award\nattracted more than 240 e ntries.\nThis doesn’t mean, of course, that just any failure or mistake is\nencouraged or celebrated. But if a team is operating within strategic,\ncommercial, ethical and legal frameworks and avoids recreating old mistakes,\na failure can and should be celebrated for the learning such experimentation\noffers. A well-known Silicon Valley credo holds that it is crucial to\ndistinguish a “good”  failure, one done for all of the right reasons and that\nproduces useful results, from a “bad” one—and even from a “bad” success,where success is more luck than accomplishment—and then to reward\naccordingly.\nNot only does failure free people, ideas and capital for future learning and\nbreakthroughs, it’s also worth noting that, though rarely recognized, a\ncorporate culture that accepts failure benefits from diminished internal\npolitics and much less in the way of pointing fingers and “blame games”\nthanks to trust, transparency and ope nness.\nThere are some limitations to the Lean Startup approach, including lack of\ncompetitor analysis or considerations in design thinking. Also, it is important\nto note that the ability to fail is much easier in software and information-based\nenvironments because iteration is so much easier. For a hardware company,\nit’s much harder to iterate. Apple launches hardware only when it’s perfect.\nYou wouldn’t want to iterate and fail fast when building a nuclear reactor.\nAs Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer state in their new book , The Innov ator’s\nMethod: Bringing the Lean Start-up into Your Organization: “Don’t try to\nscale it until you nail it.”\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Keeps processes aligned with\nrapidly changing externalities\n• Maximizes value capture\n• Faster to market (MVP)\n• Risk taking provides an edge and\nfaster learning• Measurement and\ntracking of experiments\n• Cultural acceptance\n(failure=experience)",

        "name": "Autonomy",
        "contents": "Autonomy\nWe describe Autonomy as self-organizing, multi-disciplinary teams\noperating with decentralized authority. Valve Software, a game company, is a\nmost unusual enterprise. It has 330 staffers but no classic management\nstructure, reporting lines, job descriptions or regular meetings. Instead, the\ncompany hires talented, innovative self-starters, who decide which projects\nthey wish to join. They are also encouraged to start new projects, so long as\nthey fit the company’s MTP. Autonomy is a prerequisite for permissionless\ninnov ation.\nExtreme autonomy—relying on small, independent, multi-disciplined\nteams—has worked well for Valve. It has a higher revenue-per-employee\nnumber than any other gaming company, and its approach enables changing\nroles and activities for all workers. This organizational style also creates asociable, open and trusting culture featuring a highly satisfied staff. In fact, the\ncompany is confident enough in its way of doing business that its employee\nmanual is open sourced and available to anyone, including competitors.\nValve isn’t alone in pioneering new organizational models in order to amp\nperformance. Its approach to autonomy is similar to the MIT Media Lab: both\nare passion-driven organizations in which employees and students are self-\nstarters who launch their own projects or pick from a collection of ongoing\nprojects. Some projects are even begun with external partners for the sole\npurpose of collaborating on innovative ideas.\nIn perhaps the most extreme case of Autonomy, Philip Rosedale, founder and\nformer CEO of Second Life and founder and CEO of High Fidelity, has made\nit a practice at High Fidelity to have his employees vote each quarter on\nwhether or not to keep him on as CEO. In addition, instead of relying on\nemployee reviews, share options are allocated on an anonymous peer-to-peer\nbasis.\nFrom teleworking to outsourcing to flattened, virtual organizations, there\nhas been a clear and steady trend toward increased autonomy in the\nworkplace. As a result, we predict the lightweight OKR approach will\ngradually replace traditional top-down managerial oversight. Furthermore,\nmany Exponential Organizations are organizing internally—though not in\ntraditional departments with layers of middle management, but rather by self-\norganized, interdisciplinary teams and with radically decentralized authority.\nThe Millennial generation, armed with Internet and gaming skills, which\ncultivate a self-starter and entrepreneurial mindset, is increasingly at odds\nwith classic hierarchical structures that are optimized for efficiency over\nadaptability.Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar Animation Studios and president of Pixar\nAnimation and Walt Disney Animation, expands on this idea in his New York\nTimes bestselling book , Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces\nThat Stand in the Way of True Inspiration: “We start from the presumption\nthat our people are talented and want to contribute. We accept that, without\nmeaning to, our company is stifling that talent in myriad unseen ways. Finally,\nwe try to identify those impediments and try to fix them.”\nThe need for autonomy and decentralization is further driven by\nincreasingly critical and knowledgeable consumers who expect zero latency\nservice and delivery, and are quick to complain on review sites if their ever-\nclimbing expectations are not met. One survey by McKinsey found that after\nexperiencing poor customer experience, 89 percent of consumers switched\ntheir business to a competing company. On the flip side, 86 percent said they\nwere willing to pay more for better customer experience. These hypercritical\nand demanding consumers can only be satisfied with companies placing their\nmost empowered and proactive employees on the front line.\nA good example of this trend towards Autonomy is a company called\nHolacracy, which has taken Agile techniques from the software world and the\nLean Startup approach and extended them to all aspects of the organization.\nHolacracy (a concept as well as the company’s name) is defined as a social\ntechnology or system of organizational governance, in which authority and\ndecision-making are distributed via fractal, self-organizing teams rather than\nbeing vested at the top of a hierarchy. The system combines Experimentation,\nOKRs, ope nness, transparency and Autonomy.\nThe following table compares traditional organizational characteristics\nwith autonomous organizations like those advoc ated by Holacracy:\nWithout Holacracy With Holacracy\nCentral control and Distributed control and authorityauthority\nPredict and plan for long\ntermDynamic and flexible: changes can\nand are constantly occuring\nHierarchic structure OR\nflat, based on consensusNeither, as everyone is the ‘highest\nauthority’ in their own role and\n‘follower’ of other roles\nInterest oriented Core goal oriented\nTension as a problem Tension as fuel\nReorganization and\nchange managementNatural development, evolution and\nmovement\nJob titles Dynamic roles\nHeroic leaders,\nemployees and process\nsupervisorsVital people who fulfill their role\nOrganizing people Organizing work\nInstrumental use of human\nrelationships to serve\nOrganizational goalsClear separation between people,\nrelationships and roles\nHolacracy is said to increase agility, efficiency, transparency, innovation\nand accountability within an organization. The approach encourages\nindividual team members to take initiative and gives them a process by which\ntheir concerns or ideas can be addressed. The system of distributed authority\nalso reduces the burden on leaders to make every decision alone.\nImportantly, Autonomy does not imply a lack of accountability. As\norganizational design expert Steve Denning explains it: “There are still\nhierarchies in a network, but the hierarchies tend to be competence-based\nhierarchies, relying more on peer accountability than on authority-based\naccountability—that is, accountability to someone who knows something,\nrather than to someone simply because they occupy a position, regardless ofcompetence. It is a change in the role of the manager, not an abolition of the\nfunction.”\nThe following shows some enterprises at the cutting edge of organizational\nautonomy:\nMedium (2012)  – 40 e mployees\nMarket: Content platform. Medium is a new Internet site\nwhere people can share ideas and stories in more than\n140 c haracters. Not just for friends.\nHow is the company organized? Medium has no people\nmanagers and emphasizes maximum autonomy. Key\ncomponents at Medium are:\n• Tension resolution (identify issues and resolve them\nsystematically).\n• Organic expansion (employees can hire personnel if a\njob de mands it).\n• Decision-making power distributed and consensus\nseeking discouraged.\nWhat is the financial impact? Recent investment in 2014,\nvaluing the company at $250 m illion.\nZappos .com (1999)  – 4,000 e mployees\nMarket: Online retail market for shoes and clothing\nHow is the company organized?\n• Company places great emphasis on company culture and\ncore values.\n• Zappos pays people to leave if they don’t fit into thecompany culture.\n• Employees encouraged to go beyond traditional\ncustomer service.\n• Representatives encouraged to make decisions on their\nown.\n• No job standards available.\nWhat is the financial impact? In November 2009,\nZappos .com was acquired by Amazon.com in a deal\nvalued at $1.2 billion on the day of closing. Gross sales\nexceeded $1 billion in 2008 (20 percent better than the\nyear before) and 75 percent of its customers are repeat\nbuyers. Company profitable since 2006.\nValve Corp (1996)  – 400 e mployees\nMarket: Game development\nHow is the company organized?\n• Company has no managers.\n• Every employee has the freedom to create without\nhaving to worry about the consequences of failure.\n• Employees are encouraged to select and work on their\nown projects.\n• Employees are responsible for go/no go of projects and\nfor hiring personnel.\nWhat is the financial impact? Over 75 million active users\non the social entertainment platform. $2.5 billion equity\nin 2012.\nMorning Star Company (1970)  – 400 t o 2,400 e mployees (more\nduring harvest)Market: Agribusiness and food pr ocessing (tomato)\nHow is the company organized?\n• No supervisory management.\n• Employees are encouraged to innovate independently,\ndefine job responsibilities themselves, make equipment\npurchasing decisions.\n• Employees negotiate and set individual responsibilities\nwith fellow workers.\n• Compensation is peer-based.\nEach employee crafts a Colleague Letter of\nUnderstanding (CLOU), which outlines how worker will\nmeet the personal mission statement. Associates most\naffected by this person’s work must accept the CLOU\nbefore it goes into effect.\nWhat is the financial impact? The company has funded\nvirtually all its growth from internal sources, which\nsuggests it is robustly profitable. On the basis of its own\nbenchmarking data, Morning Star believes it is the\nworld’s most efficient tomato processor.\nFAVI (1960)  – 440 e mployees\nMarket: Designer and manufacturer of coppe r alloy\nautomotive components\nHow is the company organized? FAVI has no hierarchy or\npersonnel department, and there is no middle management\nor formal procedures. Teams are organized around\ncustomers. Each team is responsible not only for the\ncustomer, but for its own human resources, purchasing\nand product development.What is the financial impact? In 2010 FAVI generated a\nturnover of €75 million, 80 percent of it automotive. 38\npercent of personnel have been with the company for over\n15 years. Workforce grew from 140 t o 440.\nOther companies that have implemented autonomous structures include W.\nL. Gore & Associates, Southwest Airlines, Patagonia, Semler, AES,\nBuurtzorg and Springer.\nUniversity of Michigan economist Scott Page found that diverse teams are\nmore successful at answering complex questions than are homogenous groups\nor individuals, even if the homogenous groups and individuals are more\ntalented. His conclusion, however, shouldn’t be all that surprising. Charles\nDarwin discovered that evolution progressed fastest wherever small groups\nof a species isolated from the main popu lation adapted to stressful conditions.\nBy the same token, small, independent and interdisciplinary teams are critical\nto future organizations, especially at the edges.\nA final note: Approaches towards employee autonomy, like those found at\nHolacracy, are not just for small companies. Large organizations, including\nZappos  and Semler, have also adopted this structure across much bigger\noperations.\nHarvard professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter puts it best: “When dealing\nwith a rapidly changing environment and the fluid bou ndaries of business units\nthat come and go, more work will be done by crosscutting project teams, and\nthere will be more bottom-up self-organizing.”\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Increased agility\n• More accountability at customer\nface• MTP (as a gravity well)\n• Self-starting employees\n• Dashboards",

        "name": "Social Technologies",
        "contents": "• Faster reaction and learning\ntimes\n• Better morale\nSocial Technologies\nSocial technology is an overused industry buzz phrase that has been giving\nCIOs heartburn for the last decade. Regardless, however, it has had the effect\nof pushing old analog business environments to become more digital, low-\nlatency environments. Social technologies—whose analog counterpart, of\ncourse, is the so-called water cooler effect—create horizontal interactions in\nvertically organized companies.Social technology is finding fertile ground because the workplace has\nbecome increasingly digitized. It started with email, which provided\nasynchronous connectivity; next came wikis and intranets that provided\nsynchronous information sharing; today we have activity streams that provide\nreal-time updates throughout organizations. As Marc Andreessen said,\n“Communication is the basis for civilization and will be a catalyst and\nplatform in the future for more innovations in many industries.” The reason we\nthink this is important is the frame that social business expert Theo Priestley\nputs around it when he says, “Transparency is the new currency. Trust is the\nbill we’ll just be paying for.” Priestley’s equation for social business is:\nCONNECTION + ENGAGEMENT + TRUST + TRANSPARENCY.\nWhen it comes to advancing your business, J.P. Rangaswami, chief\nscientist at Salesforce, views social technology as having three key\nobjectives:\n1. Reduce the distance between obtaining (and processing) information and\ndecision-making.\n2. Migrate from having to look up information to having it flow through\nyour perception.\n3. Leverage community to build out ideas.\nFrom our perspective, Social Technologies are comprised of seven key\nelements: Social objects, Activity streams, Task management, File sharing,\nTelepresence, Virtual worlds and Emotional sensing.\nWhen implemented, these elements create transparency and connectedness\nand, most importantly, lower an organization’s information latency. The\nultimate objective is what the Gartner Group calls a zero latency enterprise\n—that is, a company in which the time between idea, acceptance and\nimplementation all but disappears—and implementing one can provide\nsignificant return on investment.Just how significant? Forrester Research studied one implementation of\nMicrosoft’s Yammer enterprise social network within a 21,000- employee\norganization. During a payback period of just 4.3 months, and with only one\nthird of the workforce using the product, the company saw an ROI of 365\npercent.\nGiven such results, it’s not surprising that Yammer now has 8 million\ninstallations. Similarly, Salesforce’s Chatter product grew from 20,000 active\nnetworks in February 2011 to 150,000 in less than eighteen months. Further,\nSalesforce’s data indicates that employee engagement among companies that\nadopt its platform increases by 36 percent and access to information speeds\nup 43 pe rcent.\nEmployee relationship management is just one type of social object that is\nbeing information-enabled. Also in the mix are location, physical objects,\nideas and knowledge—including updates to pricing data, inventory levels,\nmeeting room occupancy and even coffee refills. All are now being broadcast\ncompany-wide and are the basis of activity streams to which anyone in the\norganization can subscribe.\nTask management is also becoming increasingly social. In the past, it\nwas mostly used as a to-do list, but it is now shifting towards a more Agile\napproach. Teams are continuously measuring themselves by pushing codes\nand closing tickets, living by the metrics that task management software\nprovides. Asana, a software company founded by Dustin Moskovitz (a co-\nfounder of Facebook ) and Justin Rosenstein improves work productivity, and\nis based on the principle that “your to-do list should be just as addicting as\nyour Facebook  wall.”\nFile sharing, the fourth leg of the social stool, has recently enjoyed\nwidespread adoption. Tools, from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox  and\nMicrosoft’s OneDrive, are vital to sharing information and providing updates\nto a single instantiation of customer information. For example, Citibank oncehad more than three hundred different customer databases, each consuming\nvaluable overhead and costing enormous sums in duplication and redundancy.\nSuch drag on costs and operations is simply not acceptable in an Exponential\nOrganization—or, indeed, for any company trying to compete in the 21\ncentury.\nTelepresence has been around for many years in the form of\nvideoconferencing. Although videoconferencing was quite a hassle in the past,\nan organization can now leverage services such as Skype and Google\nHangout, which are fast, easy to use and available on every device.\nTelepresence enables employees to work proactively from any location and\ninteract on a global scale, reducing travel costs and improving well-being.\nEven greater improvement comes from Telepresence robots such as Beam,\nfrom Suitable Technologies, and Double Robotics, which leverage the user’s\ntablet. These robots even allow the user to be on multiple locations at once,\nwhich can greatly impact how to conduct business.\nWhile Telepresence lets people interact in a real environment, virtual\nreality allows interaction, collaboration, coordination and even prototyping in\na virtual world. Philip Rosedale’s Second Life is one of the best-known\nexamples: “One of the things about Second Life was that it enabled somebody\nlike IBM to basically set up a big get-together with a thousand people from\naround the world,” he says. Although Second Life didn’t fully meet customer\n(or investor) expectations and stoppe d growing after a few years, it has\nremained consistent, with one million people online every month and an\neconomy of $600 m illion in transactions.\nTo enable a fully immersive virtual world, Rosedale’s new High Fidelity\nplatform is leveraging hardware such as Oculus Rift, the PrimeSense depth\ncamera and the Leap Motion gesture controller. The High Fidelity\nenvironment has reduced the time lag between gesture and system response tostalmost the speed of human perception, resulting in a truly real-time\nexperience.\nEmotional sensing, the last key element of social technology, makes use\nof sensors—such as health sensors and neurotechnology—within a team or\ngroup to create Quantified Employees and a Quantified Workforce.\nEmployees will be able to measure everything about themselves and their\nwork, preventing illness, burnout and irritation, and also improving team\nflow, collaboration and performance. While work in the past was mostly\nfocused on the importance of the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the Emotional\nQuotient (EQ) and Spiritual Quotient (SQ) are now becoming increasingly\nimportant metrics as well.\nThe entire social paradigm presents several critical implications for\nExOs. Organizational intimacy is increased, decision latency is reduced,\nknowledge improves and is more widely spread, and serendipity increases. In\nshort, social technologies enable the real-time enterprise.\nFinally, the social paradigm also serves as a gravity force, keeping the\norganization tightly connected to its MTP and ensuring that its diverse parts\ndon’t drift away in pursuit of conflicting, even oppos ing, goals.\nWhy Important?Dependencies or\nPrerequisites\n• Faster conversations\n• Faster decision cycles\n• Faster learning\n• Stabilizes team during rapid\ngrowth• MTP\n• Cloud social tools\n• Coope rative culture\nIf you remember our list of linear attributes of traditional organizations\nfrom way back in Chapter Two, we can now juxtapose linear versus\nexponential characteristics:Linear Organization\nCharacteristicsExO Characteristics\nTop-down and\nhierarchical in its\norganizationAutonomy, Social Technologies\nDriven by financial\noutcomesMTP, Dashboards\nLinear, sequential\nthinkingExperimentation, Autonomy\nInnovation primarily\nfrom withinCommunity & Crowd, Staff on\nDemand, Leveraged Assets, Interfaces\n(innovation at the edges)\nStrategic planning\nlargely an\nextrapolation from the\npastMTP, Experimentation\nRisk intolerance Experimentation\nProcess inflexibility Autonomy, Experimentation\nLarge number of FTEsAlgorithms, Community & Crowd,\nStaff on Demand\nControls/owns its own\nassetsLeveraged Assets\nStrongly invested in\nstatus quoMTP, Dashboards, Experimentation\nLet’s now look back at our definition of an ExO: “An Exponential\nOrganization is one whose impact (or output) is disproportionally large—\nat least 10x larger—compared to its peers because of the use of new\norganizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies.”As we have researched the paradigm, we have uncovered over sixty\norganizations with scores over our ExO threshold, each achieving at least a\n10x performance improvement over others in its space. The following are our\ntop 10 (in alphabetical order): Airbnb, GitHub, Google, Netflix, Quirky,\nTesla, Uber, Waze, Valve, Xiaomi.\nIt may seem odd to look back four centuries to capture the essence of the most\nmodern of company organizations. Nevertheless, Isaac Newton’s second law\nprecisely summarizes the overall concept of an Exponential Organization. The\nlaw, F = MA, states that force causes acceleration in inverse proportion to\nmass. A small mass allows dramatic acceleration and quick changes in\ndirection—precisely what we’re seeing with many ExOs today. With very\nlittle internal inertia (that is, number of employees, assets or organizational\nstructures), they demonstrate extraordinary flexibility, which is a critical\nquality in today’s volatile world.\nThis remarkable characteristic has been well demonstrated by Netflix. As\nmentioned earlier, the company offered a $1 million prize (Engagement) to\nanyone who could improve its rental recommendation program. What is less\nwell known is that Netflix never implemented the winning al gorithm.\nWhy? Because, tellingly, the market had already moved on. By the\nconclusion of the contest the industry had shifted away from rental DVDs;\nmeanwhile Netflix’s streaming video business was exploding and,\nunfortunately, the winning algorithm didn’t apply to streaming\nrecommendations. (Streaming was much less a matter of gathering the family\ntogether on a Friday night with popc orn than of having forty-five minutes at an\nairport to watch an episode of Mad M en.)Now, imagine that Netflix had invested the 2,000 hours the winning team\nspent on the project to develop that very same, now-obsolete algorithm. With\nprevalent sunk-cost biases and institutional insistence to see a return on that\ninvestment (plus the egos involved), there would have been enormous internal\npressure within the company to implement the algorithm, regardless of market\nrealities. As a result, Netflix might have not have altered course to become,\nprimarily, a streaming business—which, as we now know, would have been a\ndevastating mistake. But because the algorithm was developed externally,\nthere was much less corporate emotional attachment (i.e., mass) and inertia\n(force) to its implementation. Netflix was free to focus elsewhere, ultimately\nallowing it to evolve into the streaming content giant it has become.\nThe key question for any organization is not whether you “look” like an\nExponential Organization, but “How exponential are you?” That is, how much\nhave you internalized the philosophy of being an ExO? How does it inform\nyour daily operations in terms of autonomy and social technology? How\nefficiently do you use the right tools, from dashboards to interfacing? And\nhow open are you to risk, to experimentation and even to failure?\nThese are questions you need to ask yourself—not just once but every\nmonth or even week. That’s what it takes to be become, and remain, an\nExponential Organization.\nKey Takeaways\nExOs manage the abundant output of SCALE\nexternalities with guidance from their MTP and\nthe control framework of five internal IDEAS\nelements:Interfaces\nDashboards\nExperimentation\nAutonomy\nSocial Technologies\nThe more assets and workforce you have, the\nharder it is to switch strategies and business\nmodels. The more information-enabled you are,\nthe more strategic flexibility you have.\nA diagnostic survey (Appendix A or\nwww.exponentialorgs.com/survey) will help\nmeasure the Exponential Quotient of your\norganization.\nInterfaces create frictionless migration from\nexternal to internal attributes.\nSCALE and IDEAS elements are self-reinforcing\nand integrative.CHAPTER FIVE\nImplications of Exponential\nOrganizations\nWhile the notion of an Exponential Organization may seem revolutionary, in\nfact many of its characteristics have long shown up in certain corners of the\nbusiness world—m ost notably, Hollywood.\nWhy did Hollywood, 3,000 miles away from both the acting world of\nBroadway and the banking center of New York City, become the world capital\nof the film industry by the end of the 1920s ? Initially, it was due to little more\nthan an abundance of natural lighting. But soon there was a second reason.\nThe West Coast was far removed from the traditional culture of the East, and\nwith its almost unlimited cheap real estate and pliant local government, the\nearly film barons were free to do almost anything they wanted, including\nwriting their own rules.\nThe result was the studio system, in which early filmmakers set out to\nown the entirety of their assets and their workforces, from the sets to the\nstudios to the employees. Even actors were contracted to single studios, and\ndistribution was exclusive to the theaters owned by that studio.\nThis strategy quickly built one of the most valuable industries on the\nplanet. But as the decades passed, inefficiencies and antitrust issues crept in,\nand by the 1960s , the studio system was all but dismantled. What replaced it\nwas a system that was almost the exact oppos ite of what came before.",

        "contents": "Today, Hollywood operates in exactly the same loosely coupled,\nnetworked environment of an ExO ecosystem. Each participant, from the\nwriter and actor, to the director and camera grip, manages his or her own\ncareer. Meanwhile, agents at every level help find and connect scripts with\ntalent, production companies and equipment. These days, when a film is\ncreated, a swarm of independent entities come together for the duration of the\nproduction, operating on 24/7 schedules and in close collaboration. Once the\nfilm is finished, sets are broken down for re-use, equipment is reassigned and\nall the actors, grips and production assistants disband and scatter to pursue\ntheir next projects, which often start the very next day.\nHollywood didn’t plan this metamorphosis; rather, it evolved into an\nExO-like ecosystem because it is the nature of film to be a series of discrete\nprojects. The filmmaking process itself has always been characterized by a\nsingular combination of high density, close proximity and loosely coupled\nconstituents. These factors made Hollywood a pioneer in the virtualization of\nenterprises and now, combined with new social and communications\ntechnologies, puts it in the vanguard of the rise of the Exponential\nOrganization.\nThe high-tech startup ecosystem of Silicon Valley is another example of\nthis model: entrepreneurs, employees, scientists, marketers, patent lawyers,\nangel investors, venture capitalists and even customers—all operate within a\nsmall geographic region of the San Francisco Bay Area. Another (more\ndysfunctional) example is Wall Street.\nLeveraged by new generations of technology that, thanks to Moore’s Law,\nhave emerged every few years, the infrastructure is now in place for many\nindustries to move to this framework—and they will, not only because it\nconfers enormous competitive advantage, but also because it rewards first\nmovers.",

        "name": "1. Information Accelerates Everything",
        "contents": "In this chapter, we’ll examine in depth some of the characteristics of an\nExO ecosystem. In particular, we’ve identified nine key dynamics at play:\n1. Information Accelerates Everything\nEverywhere you look, the new information paradigm, created as a result\nof Moore’s Law and other fundamental forces that bear upon the digital\nworld, is accelerating the metabolism of products, companies and industries.\nIn industry after industry, the development cycle for products and services\ngrows ever shorter. And like the shift from film photography to digital\nphotography, once you change the substrate from a material, mechanical basis\nto a digital and informational one, the match is lit for an inevitable explosion.\nIn 1995 , 710 million rolls of film were developed at thousands of\nprocessing centers. By 2005, nearly 200 billion digital photographs, equaling\nabout eight billion rolls, had been taken and edited, stored and displayed in\nways that were unimaginable just a few years before. Today, web users\nupload almost one billion photographs per day to sites like Snapchat,\nFacebook  and Instagram.\nAs we saw in Chapter One, the shift from analog to digital is occurring in\nmultiple core technologies that feature multiplier effects at their intersections.\nThis process of “virtualizing” one industry after another is not just advancing\nexponentially, but at multiples of even that as data about the many different\ncomponents of a single item or process is systematically analyzed and\nautomated by software (data analytics). And that’s just the beginning: as we\nadd trillions of sensors on every device, process and person, the process will\naccelerate even faster to an almost unimaginable pace (Big Data). Finally,\naccording to Ericsson Research, within the next eight years we will see thenext generation of mobile networks (5G) sporting speeds of five gigabits per\nsecond. Just imagine what that will make possible.\nWhen Marc Andreessen proclaimed in a 2011 Wall Street Journal article\nthat “software is eating the world,” he was addressing this very phenomenon.\nAndreessen, who helped invent the Internet browser and is now one of Silicon\nValley’s most powerful venture capitalists, argued that in every industry, and\nat every level, software is automating and accelerating the world. Cloud\ncomputing and the app store ecosystems are clear testaments to this trend,\nwith the Apple and Android platforms each hosting more than 1.2 million\napplications programs, most of them crowdsourced from customers.\nNowhere is this staggering pace of change more apparent than with the\nconsumer Internet. Many products are now launched early—unfinished and in\nperpetual beta—for the sole purpose of gathering data from users as early as\npossible to determine how to “finish” the product. Data collected from these\nearly users is quickly analyzed for insights on bugs that need fixing and the\nfeatures users most want to see. Once the changes are implemented, the\nproduct is rereleased and analyzed…a nd the process continues.\nAs LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has said, “If you’re not embarrassed\nby the product when you launch, you’ve launched too late.”\nThese days, product development cycles are measured not in months or\nquarters, but in hours or days. The Lean Startup movement, with its paradigm\nof constant iteration/experimentation, began on the Toyota car production line\nin the 1970s , moved to the Internet in the 1990s , and is today showing that it is\napplicable to almost any type of business.\nA great example of this new approach is Wercker, a delivery software\ndevelopment platform based in Holland. Wercker helps developers reduce\nrisk and eliminate waste by continuously testing and deploying code using\nadvanced testing and debugging techniques. Wercker’s goal is to free the\nindividual developer to focus on the code and the application, where suchattention is most valuable, rather than on tedious install processes or systems\nmanagement.\nThe open source movement has further accelerated this trend. A single\ndeveloper working on, say, a printer driver, can now benefit from the\ntransparency of a hundred other developers who’ve worked on similar\nprojects. And that’s just the beginning: when network effects kick in, the\noverall community begins learning at a much-accelerated pace. We can see\nthis happening in web-hosted developer communities such as GitHub and\nBitbucket.\nThis information acceleration isn’t just confined to software development.\nIt is also happening in the hardware world. Consider Illumina, a biotech\ncompany that pioneered the development of high-speed genome sequencing\nmachines. In 2008, Illumina’s products sold for $500,000 each, plus as much\nas an additional $200,000 a year in consumable supplies to keep the machines\nrunning. Meanwhile, the product development cycle for new models was\neighteen months.\nThat eighteen-month product development cycle was particularly bad\nnews. Why? Because the pace of change (driven by the new information basis\nof the genome) in the industry was so fast that the shelf life of any new design\nwas just nine months. Which meant that even while Illumina’s sales team was\nselling one version of the company’s gene sequencer, two future versions of\nthe same machine were at different points in the development cycles.\nThe cost of having three generations of technology either in inventory or\ndevelopment was enormous for everyone involved. Then, a new open source\ncommunity appeared on the scene. Called OpenPCR, it was dedicated to\nbuilding a DNA-copying machine for just $599. This was analogous to the\nHome Brew club hobby ists creating the first PCs that then revolutionized\ncomputing. The result has been an industry-wide transformation, allowingnew entrants and hobby ists into the field, which has benefitted all players in\nthe business, including Illumina.\nThough few industries have experienced such a stunning transformation as\nbiotech, similar trends can also be seen in many other hardware arenas. Thus,\nwhile a basic 3D printer in 2007  cost nearly $40,000, the new Peachy Printer\n—recently funded on Kickstarter—is now available for just $100. And that’s\nonly the start: Avi Reichental, CEO of market leader 3D Systems, sees no\nobstacles to bringing his company’s high-end 3D printers to market for just\n$399 w ithin the next five years.\nAnother example of this trend includes single-board computers for\nrobotics and education, where the open sourced Raspberry Pi platform has\nproved transformative. The same is true of single-board controllers, where\nArduino has assumed dominance. No surprise, then, that one of the most\npopu lar new memes in the computer business is that “hardware is the new\nsoftware.” Dan Barry, a former astronaut who now builds robots, notes that\nwhenever he gets stuck on a robot configuration or sensor problem, he posts a\nquestion online before he goes to bed, waking the next morning to finds\nanswers from tens of thousands of robot enthusiasts.\nThis “going digital” is fundamentally shifting the competitive landscape in\nmany sectors, allowing new entrants from unexpected places. In some\ncountries, banks are getting into the travel business. We’re also seeing travel\nagents moving into insurance and retailers into media (Amazon, Netflix). As a\nresult, whatever business you are in, chances are your competitors are not\nwhat they used to be.\nA final outcome of this trend is that we seem to be entering an era of\n“winner-takes-all” markets. There’s really only one search engine (Google),\none auction site (eBay) and one e-commerce site (Amazon). Network effects\nand customer experience lock-in seem to be at the root of this fundamental\nchange in the nature of competition.",

        "contents": "In an ExO world, purpose trumps strategy and execution overrides planning.\nReplacing five-year plans with these new, real time elements can be scary but\nit’s also liberating, and the rewards for those willing to stay on the ride will\nbe both decisive and astonishing. Besides, being eaten alive by an upstart\ncompetitor is anything but relaxing.\nThis shift will, of course, be quite challenging for large organizations,\nwhich rely on drawn-out projections and tracking for planning and control\npurposes.\n6. Smaller Beats Bigger (aka Size Does Matter, Just\nnot the Way You Think)\nRonald Coase won the 1991 Nobel Prize in Economics for his theory that\nlarger companies do better because they aggregate assets under one roof and,\nas a result, enjoy lower transaction costs. Two decades later, the reach\ndelivered by the information revolution has negated the need to aggregate\nassets in the first place.\nFor decades, scale and size have been desirable traits in an enterprise. A\nbigger company could do more, the argument went, because it could leverage\neconomies of scale and negotiate from strength. That’s one reason why, for\ngenerations, business schools and consulting firms have focused on the\nmanagement and organization of extremely large companies. And Wall Street\nhas gotten rich trading the stock of giant companies, which often merge to\ncreate even more gigantic organizations.\nAll that is changing. In The Start-up of You, Reid Hoffman shows that\ntransaction costs are no longer an advantage and that each individual can (and\nshould) manage himself or herself as a business. Why? One reason is theunparalleled and unprecedented ability of a small team today to do big things\n—an ability that grows ever greater if the exponential technologies described\nin Chapter One are put to use. Both now and in the coming years, adaptability\nand agility will increasingly eclipse size and scale.\nA telling example is how Netflix, with its centralized DVD rentals and\nsmall footprint, easily outmaneuvered and eventually destroyed Blockbuster,\ndespite its 9,000 stores and distributed geographical assets. In the software\nworld, Salesforce.com, which operates 100 percent in the cloud, can adapt to\nchanging market conditions much faster than can competitor SAP, given that\nthe latter requires customized installations onsite.\nWe’ve already discussed Airbnb, which by leveraging its users’ existing\nassets, is now valued at more than the Hyatt Hotels chain worldwide. While\nHyatt has 45,000 employees spread out across its 549 properties, Airbnb has\njust 1,324, all located in a single office. Similarly, Lending Club, Bitcoin,\nClinkle and Kickstarter are forcing a radical rethinking of the banking and\nventure capital industries, respectively. (No retail outlets are involved in\nthese new financial tech startups.)\nRichard Branson’s Virgin Group is structured to maximize the benefits of\na small-form factor. Its global research center is home to the company’s R&D\ndepartment and a unit that spins out new businesses under the umbrella brand.\nThe Branson group now consists of more than four hundred companies, all\noperating independently. Collectively, they are worth $24 bi llion.\nAs Peter Diamandis has often noted, one key advantage of a small team is\nthat it can take on much bigger risks than a large one can. This can be seen\nclearly in the graph below—courtesy of Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media\nLab—w hich shows how startups are characterized by high upside potential\nand low downside, while large organizations are characterized by just the\noppos ite.In healthcare, we currently have no solution for the new strains of\nantibiotic-resistant superbugs showing up in hospitals, which the World\nHealth Organization considers an existential threat as we enter the post-\nantibiotic era. Neither do we have a way to block the onset of allergies and\nautoimmune diseases, which afflict more than a billion people worldwide.\nQuotient Pharmaceuticals, however, aims to change that by building on the\npioneering work of Dr. William Pollack, who in the early 1960s  developed\nthe first blocking human antibody  solution, which has protected over sixty\nmillion mothers and their babies from the dreaded Rh disease. The vaccine\nresolved mother-fetus blood incompatibility, which was responsible for tens\nof thousands of infant deaths per year in the U.S. alone. By leveraging the\nbody ’s own ability to fight, the Anaheim-based company already has a\nworking product that stops most superbugs in their drug-resistant tracks—and\nthis just four years after it decided to take on the challenge. A mind-boggling\nside effect is that their products can also cure most allergies; Quotient’s\nblocking antibodies control the immune cascade response, which is\nresponsible for allergies like hay fever and asthma. Incredibly, Quotient’s\nteam consists of only ten people. Significant reasons for the capability of this\nsmall team to cover so much immunological ground is the multidisciplinary\nbackgrounds of the key personnel and the vastly decreased cost of developingproducts. Quotient has high containment laboratories and pilot fractionation\nfacilities, which allows it to separate antibodies, develop products and test\nthem in days rather than years, all in-house. The company is bypassing\ndecades of effort and the hundreds of millions in capital normally needed in\nthe bio/pharmaceutical industry.\nA fundamental question we regularly hear is: How big can an ExO get? We\nthink the more important question is: What happens to an ExO after it grows\nup?\nWhile this new paradigm is still in its early days, preliminary indications\nare that when successful, ExOs will build on the leverage created by their\nexternalities and become platforms.\nBut that answer creates its own set of questions, the most germane of\nwhich right now is: How can ExOs leverage the benefits of SCALE elements\nlike crowdsourcing, community management, gamification, incentive\ncompetitions, data science, leveraged assets and staff on demand to become\nplatforms?\nWe believe the answer is that they will wire themselves into the\ninfrastructure and start enabling other ExOs to emerge from and operate off of\nthose platforms.\nPerhaps the earliest example of this platform model was Google. Its\nsearch prowess allowed it to scale quickly, and once the company hit critical\nmass, the AdWords platform enabled self-provisioning advertising platforms\nfrom which other companies could grow. Google in turn took its share by\ntaxing that growth. Facebook  was also successful at becoming a platform,\nrelying on its extraordinary market penetration and knowledge about its users\nto spawn such ExOs as Zynga and its recent mobile efforts. Amazon is another\nsuccess story, as is Apple’s App Store ecosystem, which is probably theclearest example of an ExO product becoming a platform. MySpace and\nFriendster, on the other hand, failed to become platforms.\nSo, the answer to the question of how big an Exponential Organization can\nget yields yet another, more precise, question: How quickly can you convert\nexponential growth into the critical mass needed to become a platform? Once\nthat happens there is no practical limit. It’s one big coral reef.\nFor example, as Uber scales, it is helping its drivers buy cars. Its pre-\npurchase of 2,500 Google cars will provide an enormous data surge it can\nturn into new services. Uber today already is a platform with a critical mass\nof drivers, which allows it to move horizontally and offer new services:\npostal, gift and grocery delivery, as well as limousine and even medical\nservices. All leverage Uber’s key retail and demand-driven positioning,\nresulting in nearly instant gratification using a smartphone, combined with an\noutstanding customer experience.\nImportantly, the platform must be symbiotic and serve the feeders as well.\nWe’re all familiar with the dramatic success of Rovio’s Angry Birds. What’s\nless known is that for Rovio, Angry Birds was its 53 game—the company\nhas been at it since the early 1990s . But when creating a game twenty years\nago, companies had to create bilateral agreements with 150 different mobile\nphone companies, each of which wanted 75 percent of the revenues. All\nfocus, time and energy went into the hell of negotiating with mobile telcos.\nOnce on the Apple platform, however, Rovio only had to contend with a\nsingle point of negotiations, freeing it up to focus on its games—a scenario we\nstrongly suspect the company prefers.\nNow that the asteroid of digitized information has hit, the global economy has\nchanged forever. The era of traditional, hierarchical market domination by\ndinosaur companies is coming to an end. The world now belongs to smarter,rd",

Everything is Measurable and Anything is\nKnowable\nThe first accelerometers (devices used to measure new motion in three\ndimensions) were the size of a shoebox and weighed about two pounds.\nToday’s model is now just four millimeters across and is found in every\nsmartphone on the planet.\nWelcome to the sensor revolution, one of the most important and least\ncelebrated technological revolutions taking place today. A BMW automobile\ntoday has more than two thousand sensors tracking everything from tire\npressure and fuel levels to transmission performance and sudden stops. An\naircraft engine has as many as three thousand sensors measuring billions of\ndata points per voyage. And as we mentioned in Chapter One, a Google car,\nwith its lidar (light radar) scanning the surrounding environment with sixty-\nfour lasers, collects almost a gigabyte of data per second per car.\nThis revolution is also impacting our human bodies. In 2007, Wired\nmagazine editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly created the Quantified Self (QS)\nmovement, which focuses on self-tracking tools. The first Quantified Self\nconference was held in May 2011, and today the QS community has more than\n32,000 m embers in thirty-eight countries.\nMany new devices have been spun out of this movement. One of them is\nSpire, a QS device that measures respiration. Singularity University alumnus\nFrancesco Mosconi is the chief data officer of Spire. The analytics and\nsoftware he has written are all about real-time feedback regarding breath andhow it relates to stress and focus—not unlike the way sensor feedback in a\nBMW’s traction control system reduces wheel slip.\nWith more than seven billion mobile phones in use globally, many\nequipped with a high-resolution camera, anything and everything can be\nrecorded in real time, from a baby’s first words to the events of the Arab\nSpring. Like it or not, we are hurtling towards a world of radical transparency\n—and being driven off the privacy cliff by trillions of sensors recording our\nevery move. Beyond Verbal, an Israeli company, can analyze the tonal\nvariations of a 10-second clip of your voice to determine mood and\nunderlying attitude with an 85 pe rcent certainty.\nNow, toss into this mix Google Glass, the smart eyewear that enables\nvideo or images to be recorded or transmitted in real time anywhere as\npeople move throughout their day. Next, add drones, which cost less than\n$100 and can be flown at a variety of altitudes, their 5-gigapixel cameras\ncapturing everything in the landscape below. And, finally, consider the\nseveral nanosatellite companies which are launching mesh configurations of\nhundreds of satellites into low Earth orbit, and which will provide real-time\nvideo and images anywhere on the planet. Given the staggering pace of\ntechnological innovation, the possibilities are endless.\nOn a much more intimate level, the human body  has approximately ten\ntrillion cells operating as an ecosystem of unimaginable complexity. For all\nthat intricacy, however, we usually track our health using just three basic\nmetrics: temperature, blood pressure and pulse rate. Now, imagine if we\ncould measure each one of those ten trillion cells—and not with just three\nmetrics, but with a hundred. What would happen if we could track the enzyme\nlevels in our bloods tream, kidneys and liver and correlate those levels in real\ntime with other metrics? What larger meta-factors that we never knew even\nexisted will emerge from these mountains of data?Laser spectroscopy, for example, is currently being used to analyze food\nand drink for allergens, toxins, vitamins, minerals and calories. Companies\nalready exploring this technology’s capabilities include Apple, SCiO by\nConsumer Physics, TellSpec, Vessyl and Airo Health. Before long, laser\nspectroscopy will be used as a medical and wellness indicator, as well as to\nmeasure and track everything in our bodies, including biomarkers, diseases,\nviruses and bacteria. For example, Yonatan Adiri, founder of OwnHealth,\nuses the cloud to analyze photographs of urine test strips in order to diagnose\nmany medical conditions.\nMeanwhile, as mentioned in Chapter Three, the Qualcomm Tricorder X\nPrize will award $10 million to the first team that develops a handheld\nmedical device that not only diagnoses and monitors health conditions quickly\nand accurately, but is also capable of outperforming ten board-certified\ndoctors. Three hundred teams from around the world, including Scanadu—a\ncompany created for the sole purpose of winning the prize—are competing,\nand the prize is likely to be awarded within a year. (At least this aspect of\nStar Trek won’t take one hundred fifty years to be realized.)\nExOs are taking advantage of this accelerating trend in one of two ways:\nby creating new business models on existing data streams or by adding new\ndata streams to old paradigms. As an example of the former, consider\nPASSUR Aerospace. Since the early or late arrival of a flight can cost as\nmuch as $70 per minute, the company has set up refrigerator-sized ADS-B\n(automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) tracking stations across the U.S.\nThese stations monitor every plane in the sky and can accurately predict to the\nminute when an aircraft will arrive at its gate. In addition to offering\nenormous cost savings, the system is also being used in reverse by both the\nFAA and airlines to determine exactly when a given flight should take off.\nAs these and hundreds more examples suggest, we are moving toward a\nworld in which everything will be measured and anything can be knowable,both in the world around us and within our bodies. Only enterprises that plan\nfor this new reality will have a chance at long-term success.\nNow that we have finished describing the characteristics of ExOs and their\nimplications, we can look at the how an ExO maps onto other constructs.

This strategy failed, largely due to legal\nissues about ownership and licensing costs, although another problem was\nthat the students lacked a sense of purpose and commitment insofar as the\ncompany was concerned, which resulted in almost no contribution to the\nplatform [Experimentation]. Undaunted, Jones and Rogers took another shot at\nattracting community, this time via crowdsourcing. They were successful this\ntime around, and in March 2008,  Local Motors debuted as the first community\nto completely crowdsource a car. (The company currently has eighty-three\nemployees and three micro-factories for manufacturing.) The Local Motors\nstaff then turned its attention to evangelizing, sharing its passion for the\nproduct on numerous designer sites, which acted as magnets for a like-minded\ncommunity [Community & Crowd].\nNext, implementing Engagement, Local Motors undertook its first\ncompetition for a car design. At that time, the company had only four\nemployees, who were in charge of managing a thous and community members\n(talk about abundance). Ultimately, a hundred contest entries poured in,\nkicking off the platform’s formation. Today, the Local Motors community\nconsists of 43,100 members collaborating on 6,000 designs and 2,000 ideas\nacross thirty-one projects. Members average 200 t o 400 h ours per project.\nThe Local Motors community consists of enthusiasts, hobby ist innovators\nand professionals. They are designers, engineers and makers who participate\nin each component of the design (interior, exterior, name, logo, etc.), which is\nthen open sourced with a Creative Commons license. The platform can be\nthought of as a combination of Quirky (product development) and Kaggle\n(incentive competitions), but for cars and other vehicles.Once the initial community was established, Rogers moved on to his next\ngoal: to build the first crowdsourced automobile. In 2009, Local Motors\nachieved that goal with the production of the Rally Fighter, a car whose\nultimate design was a culmination of 35,000 designs contributed by 2,900\ncommunity members from more than 100 countries. Produced in just a year\nand a half, about five times faster than conventional processes, the Rally\nFighter cost just $3 million to develop.

The design also required\ncontestants to address social challenges specific to each location. One winner\nin each location received $2,000, and the Grand Prize winner (of a total of\n214 entries) received an additional $5,000, as well as a quarter-scale model\nof his design that was to be shown around the world.\nTogether with BMW, Local Motors launched the Urban Driving\nExperience Challenge, in which contestants were required to address the\nlikely needs of an urban BMW driver in 2025.

Local\nMotors’ next two goals are to create the world’s first 3D-printed car and to\ndesign a highly customizable car with fewer than twenty parts.\nIgnition\nWith Local Motors pointing the way, it is now time, at long last, to discuss\nhow to launch an Exponential Organization. One caveat, however: This is not\nmeant to be an exhaustive startup manual—that book  remains to be written.\nRather, we’ll discuss the elements relevant to building an ExO that is\nleveraged by information and is highly scalable, either as a pure startup or\nfrom within an existing enterprise.\nA quick but relevant side note here: We strongly recommend reading The\nLean Startup by Eric Ries as an accompaniment to this chapter, since we’ll\nbe referring to it frequently. In fact, the best definition we’ve found for a\nstartup comes from Ries: “A startup is a human institution designed to\ndeliver a new produc t or service unde r conditions of extreme uncertainty.”\nA second book  we recommend is Peter Thiel and Blake Masters’ recent\npublication, Zero to One: Notes on St artups or How to Build the Future.\nThis is perhaps the best time in the history of business to build a new\nenterprise. The confluence of breakthrough technologies, acceptance (and\neven celebration) of entrepreneurship, different crowdsourcing options,\ncrowdfunding oppor tunities and legacy markets ripe for disruption—all create\na compelling (and unprecedented) scenario for new company creation.\nFurthermore, traditional risk areas have been mitigated like never before.\nContinuing our earlier comet/dinosaur analogy: the comet has struck, thedinosaurs are teetering and the conditions are ripe for a new category of\nsmall, nimble organisms to thrive. A new Cambrian Explosion, if you will.\nWhen assessing a startup for funding, investors typically categorize three\nmajor risk areas:\nTechnology r isk: Will it work?\nMarket risk: Will people buy the product?\nExecution risk: Is the team able to function and pivot as needed?\nThe challenge facing every startup lies in discovering how to de-risk each\nof these areas and, in the process, find a business model in the chosen\nproblem space. Nothing is more important.\nLet’s look at each of these three risk areas in turn:\nTechnology Risk\nIn 1995, it cost about $15 million to build a software startup based in\nSilicon Valley. That money mostly went to build server stacks, purchase\nsoftware and hire staff to configure and manage all that technology, as well as\nto write new code. By 2005, the cost had droppe d to about $4 million.\nServers were cheaper, and software, now often open sourced, was easier to\ndevelop and configure. Most hard costs were focused on marketing and sales.\nToday, with now-established capabilities such as cloud computing and\nsocial media, that same effort costs less than $100,000. The technology risk\nthat was once enormous (particularly software) has been reduced over the last\ntwenty years by 150x . Most of the remaining risk concerns mere scalability\nissues. A case in point: the rise of standardized web services allows complex\nsoftware functionality to be integrated into a startup at the press of a button.\nExamples include Google’s Prediction API for predictive analytics and\nAlchemyAPI for deep learning software for pattern recognition.To illustrate the sheer extent of this reduced technology risk, consider\nhardware startups. A new wave of large companies in Shenzhen, China (e.g.,\nFoxconn, Flextronics, PCH International), as well as open source hardware\nplatforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and 3D printers, allow anyone to\ndesign a hardware product and quickly prototype and build it. Liam Casey, the\nCEO of PCH, has aggressively turned his company into a platform on which\nanyone can launch a hardware startup, to the extent that individual wants to\ncreate the equivalent of an App Store for hardware startups. Brady Forrest,\nhead of Highway1, a PCH incubator, puts it simply: “We want hardware to be\nas easy as software.” Indeed, hardware is increasingly dissolving into\nsoftware.\nAccording to entrepreneur Chris Dixon, the most important change for\nentrepreneurs versus a decade ago is the ratio of reach to capital. Today, the\nreach of a startup is 100x  larger, while the capital needed is one tenth that of a\ndecade ago—a  thous andfold improvement in just ten years. The result is that\ntechnology risk, particularly for largely information-based or information-\nenabled businesses, has all but evaporated. (Needless to say, if you want to\nbuild a supertanker, you still need some capital.)\nMarket Risk\nAs to whether or not anyone will buy the product, we turn once again to\nSteve Blank, who famously said, “No business plan survives first contact with\na customer.” Historically, one had to first commission classic market\nresearch, fully build the product or service, hire an expensive sales force, and\nthen spend time and money marketing the idea—all before ever really\nknowing the answer to that question.\nThe Internet took one giant bite out of that paradigm and the emergence of\nsocial media took another. Starting in the 2000s , startups could test the marketlike never before by leveraging A/B testing, Google AdWords campaigns,\nsocial media and landing pages. Now an idea could be partially validated\nbefore product engineering even began.\nThe epitome of market validation, of course, is crowdfunding. Fundraising\nsites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow users to pre-purchase a product.\nIf enough people pre-purchase, the website releases money to the developer.\nWhile there’s a great deal of understandable excitement about the\ndemocratization of the fundraising process, we think the far more interesting\nconsequence is that, for the first time in history, entrepreneurs can validate\nmarket demand before building the product.\nExecution Risk\nSo, of the three major risk areas, execution risk remains the only real issue\nin building a company. How will the enterprise organize itself to maximize\nperformance from its founders and management team? How will it leverage\ntechnology and information to create a unique and sustainable advantage and\nbusiness model? Answering these questions correctly is the key to building a\nsuccessful Exponential Organization. For this reason, we need to look more\nclosely at each of the steps in building a pow erful and effective team.\nIn 2013, Aileen Lee published an extensive overview in TechCrunch of\nU.S.-based software startups with a market value of more than $1 billion over\nthe previous ten years, a group of companies she called Unicorns. As every\ncompany increasingly becomes a software company, her findings are ever\nmore relevant for classic vertical markets and sectors as well. While we\nrecommend reading the entire article, Lee’s key findings as they pertain to\nExOs are as follows:\nIt takes more than seven years, on average, before a “liquidity event.”",

        "contents": "that they all should work together as friends rather than more formally as\nemployees. Looking back, perhaps friendship was PayPal’s MTP. Not only\nwas PayPal very successful as a company—it was sold to eBay for $1.2\nbillion—bu t the friendships that grew out of it were equally successful. The\noriginal team is now known as the “PayPal Mafia,” and its members have\nhelped one another on subsequent startups, including Tesla, YouTube,\nSpaceX, LinkedIn, Yelp, Yammer and Palantir—companies that today have a\ntotal market cap of more than $60 bi llion.\nThe pace of growth of an ExO requires an extra emphasis on a fully\nsynergistic core team. As Arianna Huffington says, “I would rather have\nsomebody  much less brilliant and who’s a team player, who’s straightforward,\nthan somebody  who is very brilliant and toxic to the organization.”\nStep 4: Breakthrough Idea\nWe don’t have to tell you that this next step is a big one. It is essential to\nleverage technology or information in some way to transform the status quo.\nAnd when we say transform, we really do mean it. ExOs are not about\nincremental improvement in a marketplace. They are about radical change.\nAccording to Marc Andreessen, “Most entrepreneurs prefer failing\nconventionally rather than succeeding unconventionally.”\nRemember, the three key success factors for an ExO idea are:\nFirst, a minimum 10x improvement over the status quo.\nSecond, leveraging information to radically cut the cost of marginal\nsupply (i.e., the cost to expand the supply side of the business should be\nminimal).Third, the idea should pass the “toothbrush test” originated by Larry\nPage: Does the idea solve a real customer problem or use case on a\nfrequent basis? Is it something so useful that a user would go back to it\nseveral times a day?\nIt is also possible to leverage a community or crowd to discover\nbreakthrough ideas or new patterns of implementation. Elon Musk set an MTP\nfor transforming transportation with his Hyperloop high-speed transportation\nidea. At the same time, he opened up the design and implementation of that\nidea to whoever wanted to take a crack at it.\nIt may seem counterintuitive to delay the breakthrough idea several steps\ninto the process. After all, legend holds that most startups begin with an\nexplosive new idea that’s then applied to a problem space. We believe,\nhowever, that it’s better to start with a passion to solve a particular problem,\nrather than to start with an idea or a technology.\nThere are two reasons for this. First, by focusing on the problem space,\nyou are not tied to one particular idea or solution, and thus don’t end up\nshoehorning a technology into a problem space where it might not be a good\nfit. Silicon Valley is littered with the carcasses of companies with great\ntechnologies searching for a problem to solve. Second, there is no shortage of\neither ideas or new technologies. After all, everybody  in a place like Silicon\nValley has an idea for a new tech business. Instead, the key to success is\nrelentless execution, hence the need for passion and the MTP. To demonstrate,\nconsider the number of times the founders of the following companies pitched\ninvestors before finally succeeding:\nCompanyNumber of Investor Pitches\nSkype 40\nCisco 76Pandora300\nGoogle 350\nWhat if Larry Page and Sergey Brin had stoppe d pitching after 340\nattempts? The world would be a very different place today. Just as intriguing:\nwhat magical technologies and businesses don’t exist today because the\nfounders gave up one investor pitch too soon?\nWe’ve said this already, but it can’t be emphasized enough:\nEntrepreneurial success rarely comes from the idea. Instead, it comes from the\nfounding team’s never-say-die attitude and relentless execution. Those who\nreally want something will find options. Those who just kind of want it will\nfind reasons and excuses. This has been the case since Hewlett and Packard\nstarted their business in that now-famous Palo Alto dirt-floor garage—where,\ndon’t forget, they began with a passion and not a product. In the end, only raw,\nunbridled passion can solve an important problem and overcome the endless\nhurdles that present themselves. As investor Fred Wilson says, “Startups\nshould be hunch-driven early on, and data-driven as they scale.”\nPayPal co-founder Peter Thiel builds on this with a profound question for\nstartup founders: “Tell me something you believe is true but [that] you have a\nhard time trying to convince others [of].” This is about conviction and passion\non the one hand, and radical, unconventional, breakthrough ideas on the other.\nAs Peter Diamandis is fond of saying, “The day before a major breakthrough,\nit is just a crazy idea.”\nTo illustrate: In a recent conversation with Elon Musk, Salim asked Musk\nabout his Hyperloop concept: “Elon, I have a background in physics and it\nseems impossible to accelerate humans to 1,000 kilometers an hour and then\ndecelerate them to zero in such a short space of time. Have you thought about\nthat?”\nMusk’s answer? “Yes, it’s an issue.”To a true entrepreneur, there are no impossibilities, just barriers to\novercome. (And yes, it turned out there is a solution to that particular physics\nproblem—qu ite an easy one, in fact—via fluid dynamics).\nAs mentioned earlier, Chris Anderson’s DIY Drones product ArduCopter\nreplicates 98 percent of the functionality of a military-grade Predator drone at\none-thousandth the cost. That’s a drone for less than $1,000. It’s also\ntransformational. Note the sudden appearance of drones in the planning\nagendas of companies as diverse as Amazon, QuiQui and UPS. This is not a\ncoincidence.\nSuch breakthrough thinking also inspires. At Singularity University,\nstudents form teams in major problem spaces such as healthcare, education,\nclean water and so on. They are then given the challenge of coming up with a\nproduct or service that could positively impact a billion people within a\ndecade [MTP]. One team, which called itself Matternet, chose pove rty as its\nproblem space after reading that 85 percent of all roads in Africa are\nregularly washed out during the wet season.\nBut how do you alleviate pove rty if you can’t easily transport people or\nitems? That question led Matternet to home in on “Transportation in\nDeveloping Countries” as its MTP. When Anderson described his DIY\nDrones idea in a lecture, the team had an epiphany: In the same way that\nAfrica leapfrogged the entire coppe r wire telephony generation by going\nstraight to wireless, why not use drones to do the same thing with\ntransportation, and avoid building roads altogether?\nThe most exciting trend in drones today is that they’re doubling their\nprice/performance ratio every nine months. That’s twice as fast as Moore’s\nLaw. A drone today can carry a four kilogram package up to a distance of\ntwenty kilometers. In nine months, that drone’s capacity will double to eight\nkilograms per twenty kilometers, and nine months after that things will get\nreally interesting at sixteen kilograms over twenty kilometers.

At the same time, TED was now free to grow much faster than\nAnderson and his team could have ever have accomplished than if its growth\ndepended solely on their management.\nThe lesson here is that it is possible to take an established, medium-sized\norganization and transform it into an ExO by thoughtfully applying ExO\nattributes.\nFor TED, the results have been phenomenal. In just a few short years,\nAnderson turned a localized program into a global media brand. Despite its\nrapid growth, however, TED never compromised on the excellence of content\nor the quality of the attendee experience that made it so great in the first place.\nLet’s look at how the ExO attributes were implemented:\nMTP: “Ideas Worth Spreading”\nCommunity & Crowd: Leverage the TED community for\nTEDx events. TED talks have turned millions of casual\nmembers into community.\nAlgorithms: Used to gauge which TED talks to promote on\nmain site.\nInterfaces: Fixed rules about how to create a TEDx event.\nDashboar ds: Live statistics on TEDx events globally.\nExperimentation: Different formats tried and evaluated\n(e.g., within corporations).\nExample 2: GitHubEver since Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 and first established the\n“open source” paradigm, a vast global community has been steadily creating\nnew software for millions of applications. One such initiative, the website\nSourceForge (www.sourceforge.net), has more than 430,000 open source\nprojects on it, some of which have achieved remarkable success.\nAside from Linux itself, perhaps the best-known open source project is the\nApache Web Server, a free piece of software created in 1996 by  a team led by\nopen source guru Brian Behlendorf, which competed with and subsequently\nhumbled mighty Microsoft. Today, Apache runs the majority of the websites\naround the world—a  fact that remains little known. In an illuminating exercise\nconducted in 1998, IBM asked a hundred blue-chip company chief\ninformation officers if they used open source software in their companies. 95\npercent said no. Yet when interviewers asked the same question of those\ncompanies’ systems administrators, 95 percent answered yes, an outcome that\nled IBM to make a major strategic shift into open source. Celebrated—e ven\nrecognized—or  not, open source software runs the Internet (and thus the\nworld) today.\nAfter that extraordinary initial success, the open source movement settled\ninto a stable, stratified environment over much the last decade, with the\ncommunity producing little in the way of new innovation. Everything changed\nin 2008,  however, when Chris Wanstrath, P.J. Hyett and Tom Preston-Werner\n(all out of Paul Graham’s Y Combinator entrepreneurial incubator program)\nfounded a company called GitHub.\nAn open source coding and collaboration tool and platform, GitHub has\nutterly transformed the open source environment. It is a social network for\nprogrammers in which people and their collaborations are central, rather than\njust the code itself. When a developer submits code to a GitHub project, that\ncode is reviewed and commented upon by other developers, who also rate\nthat developer. GitHub’s coding environment has instant messaging embeddedwithin it, along with a distributed version control system (instead of a central\ncode repository). In practice, what that means is you don’t need a server; you\nhave everything you need locally, and can start coding without first needing to\nget permission. And you can do s o anywhere, even offline.\nGitHub has successfully transformed the open source community by\nimplementing virtually all of the ExO principles. The table below shows how\nthe company has implemented an MTP, as well as SCALE and IDEAS:\nMTP: “Social Coding”\nStaff on Demand: GitHub can (and does) leverage the entire\nopen source community for internal work.\nCommunity & Crowd: Thanks to coding lessons and a\ncollaborative environment, new developers (Crowd) are\nquickly turned into users (Community). In addition,\nGitHub has created a new office for any and all\nstakeholders to drop by and contribute or learn. There is\nopen event space available for offline communities to\ngather and organize programs. GitHub explicitly doesn’t\nuse “lock-in” as a tactic, but rather focuses on respecting\nits users and being the best platform in the market space.\nAlgorithms: In GitHub’s system, feedback is codified into\nalgorithms and used for improved version control and\nworkflow.\nLeveraged Assets: GitHub doesn’t own any of the projects\nhosted on its platform, which itself runs on the cloud. The\ncompany does use some of the software from various\nprojects to enhance the platform itself—thus enlisting\nusers into improving their own work environment.Engage ment: Game dynamics are extensively used, with\nleaderboards and a reputation system. This keeps users\nengaged without forcing their participation. Feedback on\nnew code is accomplished in almost real time.\nInterfaces: The company has customized a number of\nfunctions to support its developers, including instant\nmessaging, rating and reputation systems, and software\ncoding lessons. All are embedded within the platform.\nThe core strength of the product is its highly automated\ncontrol mechanism and workflow management, which\nintegrates outputs of different external organizational\nattributes (such as software incentive competitions and\ngamification programs), as well as crowd and community\ndeliverables.\nDashboar ds: GitHub monitors value metrics about the\nplatform. This information is available internally via a\nsophisticated and intuitive control panel.\nExperimentation: Due to its decentralized, responsive,\ntransparent and self-organizing company culture, there is\ncontinuous and open iteration of new ideas in every\ndepartment across the organization. To avoid chaos,\nGitHub has developed open, easy-to-use internal\nplatforms and effective communication. Given the\nfreedom employees have to join any project, they need\nready access to training materials and documentation\nfrom across the organization; without them, switching\nprojects creates too much friction as newcomers struggleto get oriented. In this way, new team members are able\nto be productive from the first day they join a project.\nAutonomy: Authority and decision-making are completely\ndecentralized. Teams self-organize, and the staff for any\ngiven project make the key decisions on that team’s\ninitiatives. That said, everyone in the company is\nencouraged to contribute to and act as advisor on\ndecisions that are being made elsewhere in the\norganization. As a result, the recruiting process is\nprimarily focused on self-starters who have passion,\npurpose, and potential. Within the company, this is called\n“open allocation,” which essentially translates to: always\nwork on stuff you are personally excited about or that you\nfind fulfilling.\nSocial Technologies: With all employees across all\ndepartments using GitHub internally, social constructs\nand technologies are deeply embedded into GitHub’s\nplatform and culture. Indeed, it can be said that every\naspect of the product has a social feature. Thus, the de\nfacto office of the company is the chat room; email is\nused only for sending platform reminders and alerts about\nchanges to the platform. This “conversational culture”\nboos ts team morale and productivity. Senior management\nalso has a motive for enforcing this culture: clear\ncommunication is a top priority in such an experimental,\nnetworked organizational model. Team members rely on\nface-to-face conversations, calls or Hangouts for strategic\ndiscussions, while using GitHub, chat or email for more\noperational work.How well has GitHub don e with this revolutionary, exponential, corporate\nculture?\nIn six years, the company has created a community of more than six\nmillion developers working collaboratively on more than fifteen million open\nsource software projects. Even more important is that in Silicon Valley today,\nsoftware developers’ hiring prospects and even salaries are largely\ndetermined by their individual ratings on GitHub. And because of the power\nand influence of that rating system, developers are constantly adding code to\nGitHub projects in order to boost their personal ratings. This secondary\nbenefit further adds value to the community and the company.\nIn short, GitHub is not only a great example of an Exponential\nOrganization, but its product is also a powerful template for the ExO\norganizational model: collaborative, open, transparent, community-driven and\npeopled by staff well equipped and willing to self-select projects. It also\noffers 10x improvements across the board for different functions, jobs and\ndepartments. Bottom line: GitHub is an emergent organization driven by\npassion and purpose.\nAnd although GitHub is currently optimized for developers, similar\nplatforms will eventually emerge for lawyers, doctors, publicists and other\nprofessionals. The platform has already been extended into enterprise\nsoftware development with a successful paid business model, and can or soon\nwill be used by governments, non-profits and educational institutions. GitHub\ncharges users a monthly subscription—ranging from $7 to $200—t o store\nprogramming source code. Andreessen Horowitz, one of the world’s leading\nventure capital firms, recently invested $100 million in GitHub. It was the VC\nfirm’s largest investment round ever. To understand its rationale, see GitHub’s\nusage by governments around the world (and please spot the exponential\ncurve).",

After some failed early\nexperiments, Woodm an realized he had to build the waterproof housing. By\n2004, he was building his own cameras, and ultimately came to own the full\ncustomer experience. Although some success came via QVC, the television\nshopping network, sales soon stalled, and there was some minor panic in the\nface of the competing Flip Video camera’s success.\nThe turning point came in 2006,  when friends convinced Woodm an to go\nfully digital, resulting in GoPro producing its first digital video camera. In2008, GoPro introduced a wide-angle lens, but the excitement was short-\nlived; Steve Jobs’ announcement that the iPhone would feature video brought\non a second panic attack. Sales stalled once again and growth flattened. After\nseven hard years, GoPro had plateaued; the company seemed to be going\nnowhere. Meanwhile, Cisco bought Pure Digital, the maker of the Flip\ncamera, for almost $600 m illion.\nWoodm an refused to surrender. Convinced that his market was out there,\nhe continued iterating and innovating. His break finally came in late 2009\nwhen he introduced high definition (HD) video in the GoPro HD Hero.\nMeanwhile, the cost of the camera had droppe d exponentially to the point\nwhere mainstream customers could afford it. When BestBuy began selling\nGoPro cameras in 2010, s ales tripled.\nGoPro now has more than seven hundred employees (it had just eight in\n2010)  and is valued at $3 billion. In 2013, GoPro sold 3.84 million cameras\nand grossed $985.73 million (up 87.4 percent from 2012) . GoPro is currently\nranked No. 39 on Fast Company ’s World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies\nlist, and the company went public in July 2014, a culmination of a remarkable\nrun.\nSo which ExO attributes did GoPro use in 2010 and 2011 to grow\nexponentially after its plateau?\nMTP: “Help People Capture and Share Their Most\nMeaningful Experiences”\nCommunity & Crowd: Users from all over the world share\nfootage on GoPro’s website and Facebook  page, which\ncurrently has 7.5 million likes. Viewers see videos and\nare inspired to create their own. In addition, GoPro has\nbecome an open platform with open APIs. Third-partydevelopers can create additional functionality for GoPro\ndevices.\nAlgorithms: Extensive fuzzy logic embedded in the camera.\nLeveraged Assets: GoPro mostly uses manufacturers and\nsuppliers in China to produce its equipment, relying in\nparticular on Foxconn, which invested $200 million in\nGoPro in December 2012. Foxconn CEO Terry Gou is a\nGoPro advisor.\nEngage ment: GoPro held a “How will you GoPro?” contest.\nParticipants used text and visual to share their dream\nadventures. Of thousands of entries, one winner received\nan all-expense-paid trip worth $30,000. A GoPro film\ncrew accompanied the winner and helped create his\nmotorcycle adventure. The company also has a daily\nincentive competition in which it gives away one of\neverything the company makes.\nExperimentation: Pivots amongst camera quality (HD),\nwhere to use it (use cases), rights management and\ndistribution outlets (Best Buy).\nSocial Technologies: Heavy use of YouTube, Facebook and\nthe historic Felix Baumgartner space jump, which\nreceived 8 m illion views.\nAlthough GoPro has done very well in the last four years, it still faces\nmajor challenges—not the least of which is the slow decline of Best Buy and\nother big box retailers, which are the company’s primary distribution\nchannels. But as an example of a flat company that leveraged ExO attributes to\ntransform itself, it’s hard to find a better example. GoPro easily qualifies as\nan ExO, having increased sales by more than 50x over a five-year period.So, can established companies adopt ExO processes and produce 10x\nresults? The answer, as we have seen in this chapter, is a resounding yes. But\nit is always challenging, and there is no well-marked path for getting there.\nWhen it comes to established companies, every ExO solution is a custom\ncreation.\nExperience has shown that transforming an existing enterprise into an\nExponential Organization requires two things. The first is a company culture\nthat can quickly adapt to rapid, often radical, change. Coyote Logistics\nsucceeded thanks to its comparatively small and focused staff and the fluid\nnature of its clients. Robert Goldberg succeeded at Zynga because he was\nworking with employees and operations brought on board as a result of\nacquisitions, which meant that the workers had no history with their new\nemployer, and thus had no precedents to fall back on. And GitHub was almost\nentirely virtual from the start, so could easily change the requirements for\nparticipation. Needless to say, imposing the ExO model on a more traditional\ncompany—on e with a hardened culture or a rigid managerial hierarchy—is\nmuch more difficult.\nStill, it can be done. We are convinced that any stabilized environment or\nmid-market company can leverage ExO principles and transform itself to\nachieve exponential growth.\nThat leads us to the second requirement for turning an established\ncompany into an exponential one: a visionary leader who has the full support\nof the board and senior management. Accelerating a company to blinding\nspeeds, empowering employees and customers, and emplacing a sophisticated\nand sweeping technical infrastructure takes a leader who not only thinks big\nand acts decisively, but who also has the backing of the most powerful people\nin the company—pe ople who won’t shut the whole thing down once things get\nscary, or when they get a nosebleed. Goldberg’s success at Zynga came not\njust from his own talent and trust in his people, but also from the company’sfearless top management. For established companies wishing to go\nexponential, the character and courage of the board of directors and executive\nrow will often prove more decisive than their competence.\nPerhaps the best example of such leadership today is Elon Musk. With the\nsupport of a strong board and visionary investors like Steve Jurvetson,\nMusk’s tenacity and drive have carried him through extreme tests. Tesla, now\nten years old, saw its growth level off in 2011 and 2012, a nd was on the verge\nof bankruptcy and layoffs for its five hundred employees. After an injection of\nfunds from Jurvetson’s DFJ fund, the company launched the Tesla S, which\nwas named Car of the Year in 2013 by Motor Trend magazine and declared\nthe safest car ever built. Not content to rest on his laurels, Musk next open\nsourced all company patents and is launching a new battery factory (an EExO)\nthat will power other brands. From an ExO perspective, perhaps the most\ninteresting example of 10x improvement is the leverage provided by an\nelectric motor. The drivetrain of the Tesla S has just seventeen moving parts\n—compare that to the several hundred moving parts in a conventional car’s\ndrivetrain. By leveraging an MTP, opening the intellectual property to the\ncommunity and taking advantage of accelerating technologies, Tesla\nrevitalized itself from a stalled mid-market company. Its market cap in the last\nyear has increased from $4 bi llion to ove r $30 bi llion.\nA final word on managing fast-tracked growth comes again from Chip Conley,\nwho created the Joie de Vivre chain of specialty hotels and is now part of\nAirbnb’s senior management team. Conley found that the more information-\nbased we become, the greater the need to rely on rituals and meaning to\nstabilize companies and keep teams motivated. Thus, as ExOs take on larger\nnumbers of employees, individual tasks and functions increasingly need the\ngravity well of an MTP to provide purpose. Although that would seem to addto the burden of bigger companies trying to become ExOs, the fact that\nestablished companies are better at those rituals, stories and legends—the\nglue that holds organizations together—works to their advantage, especially\nwhen they are accelerating exponentially.\nIn the next chapters, we’ll take on the toughest nut of all and look at what\nlarge organizations need to do t o retrofit ExO thinking into their world.CHAPTER EIGHT\nExOs for Large Organizations\nRamez Naam spent thirteen years at software giant Microsoft, leading early-\nstage development for new products, including Outlook, Internet Explorer\nand Bing. In that role, Naam was uniquely positioned to observe not just\nMicrosoft, but many of its clients and competitors—and not just in their high-\ngrowth stages, but also as mature companies.\nIn 2008, Naam had an epiphany. The 20th century had seen the defeat of\ntop-down structures, such as communism and managed economies, by\nbottom-up frameworks, including democracy and capitalism. And yet, he\nrealized, despite this historic lesson, the structure of most corporations\nremained completely hierarchical and top-down.\nNaam also observed that as a result of this top-down focus, the flow of\ninformation in large corporations inevitably followed a slow, circular\nmotion. Information initiated from senior management and slowly cascaded\ndown through the ranks. Eventually, frontline employees used this potentially\nobsolete information to perform a fixed set of scripted tasks. They then\ngathered the results and returned them to the flow, passing the tasks upward\nthrough layers of management until those results eventually reached the\nexecutive boardroom once more. There, new decisions were made—and\nagain a new set of commands was sent dow n through the organization.\nBesides the obviously glacial pace of this process, Naam also noted that\nit actually increased the distance between information and decision-making,",

        "contents": "resulting in the following structural failures:\nInformation moved slowly and insights took a long time to be\nimplemented.\nReality, as with the game of “Telephone,” became distorted at each\npoint of transfer.\nThe flow pattern of the information inevitably bypassed a tremendous\namount of intermediary brainpower and experience.\nThe process often caused organizations to behave in a sociopathic\nmanner, ultimately forcing employees to do things against their better\njudgment.\nWe can generalize the many issues facing large organizations to the\nfollowing three:\nMost focus and attention is internal, not external.\nEmphasis tends to be on technologies with existing expertise;\nconverging technologies or adjacencies tend to be ignored and\nbreakthrough thinking is punished.\nReliance on innovation from inside rather than outside.\nNaam wasn’t the only investigator surprised by what he found in many\nmodern corporations. Jason Yotopou los, who spent several years at SAP as\nexecutive vice president of global research, interviewed senior executives at\nthree dozen multinational companies, ultimately finding himself in agreement\nwith the words of organizational theorist John Seely Brown: “Companies\nmay promote the idea of new business creation, [but] in the end they are all\nin the business of reducing risk and building to scale—which is, of course,\nthe antithesis of entrepreneurship and new ventures.”\nAlong the way, Yotopou los also discovered that the new-business teams\nat these companies were almost always staffed with internal companypersonnel, which almost guaranteed a conservative approach and more-of-\nthe-same outcomes.\nYotopou los’ and Naam’s observations underscore our overall thesis that\ntraditional and large organizational structures simply do not fit the current\n(and certainly not the future) paradigm for organizations. This shouldn’t be\ntoo surprising: disruptive new ideas never map onto the traditional\norganization chart, and mature companies, above  all else, are all about org\ncharts.\nSalim came to the same conclusion back in 2007 as head of Brickhouse,\nYahoo’s internal incubator, specifically during a period when Yahoo was\ncontemplating acquiring Twitter. The problem, he quickly realized, was that\nalthough the young social networking company could be force-fit into any of\nfive different Yahoo business units, ultimately it wouldn’t fit well anywhere.\nWhy? Because Twitter’s product and culture were just too alien to the more-\nestablished company. In addition, it was hard to figure out exactly what\nbusiness Twitter was in—which is as true today as it was then. In the end, the\ndecision not to follow through with the acquisition was more impacted by\norganizational considerations than strategic ones.\nThink back to the Iridium layer story from Chapter One. Its message\nshould serve as a wake-up call to all large and established companies.\nAlready dinosaurs, they’ve been hit by a comet of information and are at\nincreased risk of extinction. Nowhere is this more the case than among\ninsular organizations, regardless of the industry, that rely heavily on\nmanpower or are asset-based. All are subject to the extreme threat of\ndisruption. As Peter Diamandis says, “If you are relying on innovation solely\nfrom within your company, you’re dead.”\nAs we enter what Dave Blakely of IDEO calls “a programmable world,”\nwhat is a large and established organization to do?  Answer: Transform.Transformation isn’t easy, however. A big company is like a supertanker:\nit takes a long time to turn. Nonetheless, it can be done. There are many\nexamples of big companies morphing into new markets over time. For\nexample, Nokia used to be a tire company, Samsung was once a trading\ncompany and Intel got its start in memory chips. GE, a company with a long\nand distinguished history, has repeatedly reinvented itself.\nFew companies, however, are able to transform quickly. Apple and IBM\nare two rare examples of large companies that have successfully undertaken\nan extreme transformation and executed it fairly quickly. And in both cases,\ninspiration grew out of desperation; each company was just a few months\nfrom running out of cash. At the same time, each also enjoyed a charismatic\nand bold leadership that was able to use dire circumstances as an impetus to\nturn the company around.\nAs economist Paul Romer has said, “A good crisis is a terrible thing to\nwaste.” But waste is exactly what most companies do, and the vast majority\nof eleventh-hour turnarounds don’t end well. As we pointed out in the\nIntroduction, the average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has fallen from\nsixty-seven years a century ago to just fifteen years today, and 40 percent of\ntoday’s Fortune 500 c ompanies won’t exist a decade from now.\nClearly, it is not in the best interest of any established company, no matter\nits size or industry, to wait until disaster is at the gate to initiate\ntransformative risks. However, many studies have revealed that the vast\nmajority of corporate transformation projects fail. There are many reasons\nfor these failures: complexity, long project timelines, lack of support from the\ntop, exploding budgets and so on. However, a key structural reason is short-\nterm thinking driven by stock prices and the pressure on quarterly earnings.\nWhen a CEO or senior management team is faced with attempting a risky,\nlong-term transformation versus just keeping the boat steady until their stockoptions vest, the choice defaults to the do-nothing strategy. As a result, a key\nmitigating strategy currently used by many large organizations to slow this\ntrend is regulatory capture. If you can lobby  for favorable legislation, you\ncan protect yourself from external disruption. In 1998, in what critics call the\n“Mickey Mouse Protection Act,” the U.S. Congress voted to extend copyright\nprotection by an additional twenty years—a blow to creativity, and certainly\nnot in the best interest of the general public. Similarly, the cable and phone\ncompanies have aggressively pursued legal action to protect their regional\nmonopolies, even going so far as to sue cities that propos e giving away\nInternet access in an effort to spur economic development.\nIndeed, the nonpartisan United Republic found that the return on\ninvestment for lobby ing is astounding: 5,900 percent for oil subsidies,\n22,000 percent for MNC tax breaks and an astounding 77,500  percent for\nkeeping drug prices high. At these rates, it’s actually fiscally irresponsible\nnot to lobby .\nHowever, we believe that in an ExO era, such tactics are unsustainable,\nparticularly when it comes to the consumer domain. Why? Because of the\namount of time they take. The pace of adoption over the Internet far outruns\nthe regulatory process. For example, by the time taxi agencies and hotels\naround the country woke up to the threats posed by Uber and Airbnb,\nrespectively, the public had already embraced the services enough to make\nlobby ing against them that much more difficult; it was a case of swimming\nagainst the tide. The same is true of other industries, as well—just witness\nthe tension between New Jersey car dealers and Tesla’s direct sales model.\n(There’s a delightful irony in listening to automobile dealerships loudly\nproclaim they’re all about consumer protection.)\nAlong with delaying tactics, there is also a second, equally imperative\nreason not to wait until the last minute to initiate a turnaround: the cure justmight kill you. It is our firm belief that a large company cannot suddenly\nimplement the SCALE and IDEAS processes and turn itself into an ExO\novernight. It is simply too radical a transformation, one that is likely to crush\na company’s core business before it has time to find a new one. And even if\nthe company does manage to institute a new business, the internal stress\ncaused by such radical change will be extreme.\nAt the same time, established companies must transform themselves or\nthey will quickly become obsolete. Despite the well-documented difficulties\nin fostering innovation in large organizations, not to mention the endless\nnumber of innovation consultants waiting in the wings to give often bad and\nconflicting advice, a large company cannot sit by and do nothing. The\nnewspaper industry tried to do j ust that and, well…look at the result.\nIn this new high-metabolism world, where accelerating technologies are\northogonally impacting a greater and greater number of industries, large\norganizations need strategies to more closely align themselves with ExO\nthinking. We have identified four such strategies for large organizations to\ndeploy in an accelerating business world while still keeping their core\noperational businesses intact:\n1. Transform leadership.\n2. Partner with, invest in or acquire ExOs.\n3. Disrupt[X].\n4. Implement ExO Lite internally.",

While many leaders and\norganizations ignore most of the criticism and suggestions, creating an\nopen channel to the crowd and the mechanisms to determine signal from\nnoise can provide new perspectives and solutions, allowing access to\nwhole new layers of innovation.\n6. Hyper-Confident: In order to live on the exponential curve and not get\ncaught in the linear mindset of organizational bureaucracy, you must be\nwilling to be fired or even fire yourself. Battles must be fought and\nnaysayers overcome, and that requires extreme selflessness and self-\nconfidence if a leader is to push to the edge. Two of the most important\npersonality traits for an exponential leader to have are the courage and\nperseverance to learn, adapt and, ultimately, disrupt your own business.\nRecommendations: Keep diversity in mind when appointing\nto gove rnance and advisory boards. Regularly take your\nsenior leadership through a personal transformation\nprogram. Examine your own leadership skill sets. Remove\nanyone who puts his or her own career ahead of the success\nof the enterprise.\n2. Partner with, Invest in or Acquire ExOs\nFrom 1990 to about 2005, there were at least five major disruptions in\nthe retail or CPG industry. Three of them—EPOS systems with point-of-sale\ntransactions, RFID tags for supply chain management, and customer loyalty\ncards—produced a significant amount of new data that fundamentally\nchanged the industry.Marcus Shingles, a principal at Deloitte Consulting, and his research\nteam spent most of 2012 helping the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association\n(GMA) analyze the CPG industry for potential Big Data innovation\ndisruptions of the same magnitude. To his surprise, he and his team identified\nhundreds of startups with industry-specific solutions, of which eighty had\nleveraged emerging technologies. Of those eighty companies, thirty were\nalready showing signs of having a similarly disruptive impact as the three\nmajor disruptions outlined above .\nIn other words, while just a few major changes at the turn of the century\nturned the CPG industry upside down over the course of fifteen years, today\nthere are six to ten times as many potential disruptions waiting in the wings,\nall of which have emerged in the last few years. To understand the\nimportance of this sea change for the world of business—any business—it’s\nimportant to keep in mind that the CPG field is generally less innovation-\nsavvy compared to the larger and newer technology leaders, and is far\nremoved from the hipster-driven, hyper-speed world of Silicon Valley. In\nthis day and age, clearly, it’s not just cutting-edge companies that need to\nwatch their backs.\nShingles took the exercise a step further and looked at how the largest\nCPG incumbents viewed those thirty most-disruptive startups. He found that\nthere were a few big companies—the 1 percent of industry players who are\nalways ahead of the rest and continually innovating—that were not only\ntracking the startups, but had actually created partnerships with many of them.\nMeanwhile, the less forward-thinking CPGs hadn’t even heard of the\ncompetitive threats, much less considered them. Not surprisingly, the asleep-\nat-the-wheel companies were astonished when GE partnered with Quirky in\nMay 2013, a partnership that allowed Quirky inventors access to GE’sprodigious patent portfolio. (In fact, GE led Quirky’s $80 million investment\nround in November 2013.)\nIt’s this type of thinking that separates leaders from followers within\nindustries. Shingles and his Deloitte Innovation team are now talking to many\nindustry groups about similar sweeps in their areas.\nAs we stated in Chapter Five, disruption is the new norm. Throughout\nevery industry, the democratization of accelerating technologies is allowing\nhundreds of startups to attack and disrupt traditional markets: Bitcoin, Uber,\nTwitch, Tesla, Hired, Clinkle, Modern Meadow, Beyond Verbal, Vayable,\nGitHub, WhatsApp, Oculus Rift, Hampton Creek, Airbnb, Matternet,\nSnapchat, Jaunt VR, Homejoy, Waze, Quirky, Tongal, BuzzFeed—the list of\ndisruptors is virtually endless. And while of course many newcomers won’t\nsucceed, their sheer number means that plenty will be around long enough to\ncreate a revolution.\nLarge companies must identify and track disruptive ExOs with the aim of\nobserving, partnering with, investing in and/or acquiring them. And they must\ndo so as early as possible to lower the investment threshold needed and to\npre-empt the competition. The perfect moment to engage with an ExO is\nwhen the startup has real traction and is just emerging as a market leader. A\nclassic example of such timing took place in 2005 when Google bought\nYouTube for $1.6 billion. YouTube had already out-executed Google Video\nand other competitors, and was gobbling up market share. Google picked up\nYouTube just before the company broke out, and was thus able to bring in its\nown muscle to help accelerate that once-threatening expansion.\nAs with the example of GE and Quirky outlined above , Allstate Insurance\nis another example of a traditional company in a mature industry that was\nforward-thinking enough to see the writing on the wall. A few years ago,\nafter identifying and tracking the startups in Allstate’s space, CEO TomWilson concluded that the biggest threat came from new online insurance\ncompanies like Geico and Esurance, which could seriously threaten\nAllstate’s countrywide network of agents and offices. Instead of resorting to\nthe watch-and-hope strategy most CEOs adopt, Wilson went out aggressively\nand acquired Esurance in 2011. Equally important, rather than trying to\nintegrate the newcomer into its existing business, Allstate was smart—and\nbrave—enough to leave it as an independent entity, and the bigger company\nis now learning from the startup.\nThe real question then is not whether to acquire an ExO, but when to\npartner with an ExO, when to invest in one and when to acquire it.\nYotopou los, who created the Acquisition Strategy group at SAP, describes\nthe need to carefully select among the various “tools in the toolbox”—bu ild,\nbuy, partner and invest—when it comes to execution on disruptive market\noppor tunities. Each oppor tunity is shaped differently, and for this reason, one\nsize does not fit all. Instead, a more holistic approach is required.\nA corporation should look to create an internal ExO when:\n1. An oppo rtunity is one to two adjacencies away from the company’s core\nbusiness—pe rhaps a different business model, buyer, user or go-to\nmarket.\n2. Urgency is low—there is still time until the market’s inflection point.\n3. The company is able to hire the necessary talent. This approach\ntypically maximizes control and minimizes costs for those markets that\nmust be “owned” given their strategic nature.\nAcquisition is usually the most appropriate path when a market is\nstrategically imperative to “own” but you face the following obstacles:\n1. It is difficult to hire the right talent.\n2. The market inflection point is upon you.",

        "contents": "Inspire ExOs at the Edge\nCreating ExOs at the edge of your organization is no easy task, as\nGoogle’s Sebastian Thrun makes clear: “When you’re in a company and your\nmain product is search and every time you’re doing an experiment you risk\nlosing—I don’t know—a few million or one hundred million people, then\nexperimentation is really hard. Breaking out into fields that the company\nhasn’t entered before is much easier.”\nWhen SAP bought TopTier in 2001, rather than trying to integrate founder\nShai Agassi into the organization, where he would have been lost, the\ncompany instead put him at the edge of the organization and let him loose.\nAllowed to remain in his favored role as maverick, Agassi zeroed in on the\nSAP developer community, quickly realizing its untapped potential. Within\ntwo years he had created a two-million-strong developer network, a major\nasset for the company to this day.\nIn every organization, there are always changemakers like Agassi: highly\ncreative, self-starting individuals who don’t fit neatly into a box. Constrain\nthem in that box and they can sow considerable chaos. Changemakers have\nbrilliant ideas and vision—and are often fiercely loyal to the company—bu t\nthey are frustrated by limitation. Eventually, after being held back by\ninterminable management layers and bureaucratic processes, they get fed up\nand leave, or are fired. Prime examples of this phenomenon are ex-Google\nemployees Ev Williams, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Ben Silbermann and\nKevin Systrom, all of whom founded startups (Twitter, FourSquare, Pinterest\nand Instagram, respectively) after leaving Google. Google is a hugely\nsuccessful company, of course, but imagine where it would be today if those\nextraordinary individuals had stayed. (And Google has a better track record\nthan most companies.)It is critical, then, for big companies to locate change agents before their\nfrustrations grow too deep, and re-assign them to the edges of the\norganization and give them free reign to build ExOs. This will not only\nleverage the strengths of the changemakers, it will also maintain stability at\nthe heart of the organization. Furthermore, if the process is handled well and\nthe outcome is positive, cutting-edge ExOs can serve as tugboats for the\ncorporate supertanker, guiding it into new and profitable waters. Eventually,\nif successful, these fast-moving peripheral enterprises will themselves create\na new center and, ultimately, replace the legacy business. Some retailers\nhave successfully accomplished the creation of edge EExOs. Companies like\nMacy’s, Burberry, Target and Wal-Mart all created ecommerce sites outside\nand independent of their core organization and only started integration once\nthe EExO had reached critical mass. In fact, we recommend that once\nsuccessful, the legacy bricks and mortar business should report into the\nEExO, as that is the clear future. Similarly, many luxury fashion brands have\nwhite labeled Yoox, the giant Italian ecommerce site, to get to market\nquickly.\nJohn Hagel, co-chairman of the aptly named Center for the Edge, and his\nteam have developed a promising new approach to large-scale\norganizational change that he calls “Scaling Edges.” The methodology behind\nScaling Edges is built on the following basic guidelines:\nFind an edge in the form of an emerging business oppor tunity that has\nthe potential to scale quickly and become a new core for the business.\nLine up a changemaker (or team of changemakers) who understands and\nembraces that edge oppor tunity.\nPlace the changemaker/team of changemakers outside the core\norganization.Use the Lean approach and experiment with new initiatives to\naccelerate learning.\nStarve the team by providing little in the way of help, money or other\nresources.\nEncourage the team to seek leverage by connecting with other\ncompanies and participating in an ecosystem that can help accelerate\ngrowth.\nPoint the ExO outward. The fledgling enterprise should create a new\nmarket or product area, NOT cannibalize the core product suite—at\nleast in its early stages.\nThe rationale for these last three elements is that you do not want to\nawaken what Salim calls the immune response, so to speak, of the core\norganization. If the mother company senses that too many resources are being\nfunneled to the new initiative, it will evoke a reaction (the notorious\n“corporate antibodies”) and the body  will attack and try to kill the startup.\nOne explicit step we would add to Hagel’s list is to leverage data. Most\nlarge organizations have extraordinary insights and value locked up in their\ndata stores, and leveraging those insights (which Hagel would label as an\nEdge) offer some low-hanging fruit for edge ExOs to exploit. Wassili\nBertoen, managing director of the Center for the Edge Europe, notes that in\nhis seventeen years of dealing with corporate innovation, he has observed\nthat most large companies have huge unlocked potential—in fact, they’re\nbegging for a structured outlet for it all.\nWhen building out Yahoo’s Brickhouse incubator in 2007, Salim put\ntogether a team of developers, some from within Yahoo, others from the\noutside. It was, briefly, one of the best development teams in the world\n(certainly everyone at Yahoo wanted to work there). But Yahoo wanted\nBrickhouse to build new products and services for the core organization\nrather than to create new markets for the company. Needless to say, withinweeks of Brickhouse’s launch, all vestiges of autonomy at Brickhouse had\ndissolved, and feelings of jealousy and resentment toward the newcomer\nswept through the company. (“Why do they get the best employees?” “Are\nthey competing with my product?”). By the end of his tenure, Salim was\nspending 80 pe rcent of his time fending off the company in an effort to protect\nhis Brickhouse teams. Clearly a no-win situation for all parties.\nEventually, in 2008, in the wake of an attempted Microsoft purchase,\nYahoo killed Brickhouse despite it having, against all odds , launched several\nproducts that truly pushed the edges of the consumer Internet. And although\nYahoo’s immune system won that particular battle, the company ultimately\nlost the war. (Since that time, however, Salim has spent time with the new\nsenior management and is encouraged by what CEO Marissa Mayer and\nCMO Kathy Savitt are aiming for.)\nYotopou los fared better at SAP because the new businesses created in\nthat company’s Global Business Incubator were fully sheltered throughout the\ntenure of three CEOs. Another factor contributing to their success was that\nthe new companies also had a good s prinkling of ExO attributes, including:\nFull-decision autonomy with distinct processes and procedures.\nSmall, agile and bootstrapped cross-functional startup teams\nresponsible for building new businesses from the idea stage through to\ncommercialization.\nThe ability to iterate on multiple types of innovation (business model,\ngo-to-market, etc.) beyond traditional product level innovation.\nIterative in-market testing of prototypes to customers with a goal of\naccelerated learning.\nIvan Ollivier, Director of Nissan’s Future Lab, has similarly set up his\nunit in Silicon Valley, far away from headquarters, where he is exploring a",

        "contents": "The best part is that, thanks to the drastically lower costs of many\naccelerating technologies today, it doesn’t cost all that much to set up an\nadvanced laboratory. As outlined in our Chapter One table on falling\ntechnology costs, ten years ago it cost $100,000 to establish a DNA synthesis\nlab; today that price is down to about $5,000. And while an industrial robot\nwould set you back a million bucks a decade ago, the latest model of that\nsame robot (Rethink Robotics’ Baxter robot) is now available for $22,000.\nIn the realm of MEMS sensors, the outlay for accelerometers, microphones,\ngyroscopes, cameras and magnetometers has droppe d 80 percent or more\ncompared to five years ago, according to McKinsey. Finally, a 3D printer\ncarried a $40,000 price tag seven years ago; today it costs just $100. In\nshort, Moore’s Law is the modern lab’s best friend.\nRecommendation: Start an internal accelerating\ntechnologies lab, leveraging core competencies and aiming\nfor moonshot innovations at a budget price.\nPartner with Accelerators, Incubators and Hackerspaces\nThe last decade has seen an explosion of new business incubators and\naccelerators, ranging from Y Combinator (which created disruptive\nconsumer Internet startups Dropbox  and Uber) to the membership-based\nTechShop. Looking at large companies from an ExO perspective, let’s\nconsider four examples:\nTechShop\nWe first examined TechShop’s fascinating model in Chapter\nThree. Here we’ll explore the chain’s impact in further detail,\nfocusing on how TechShop is helping large organizations,including Ford and Lowe’s, two companies for which it has\nbuilt individual facilities.\nTechShop’s CEO Mark Hatch offers Fortune 500 CTOs a\ncompelling pitch: “Give me 1 percent of R&D and 1 percent of\nyour staff and I’ll return you 10x.” It’s a lofty goal, but Hatch’s\ntrack record matches the rhetoric. The founders of Solum, Inc.,\nwhich specializes in GPS-based nitrogen detection for\nagriculture, used TechShop’s facilities to carry them from\nconcept through four generations of product development,\nraising $1 million in just fourteen weeks. TechShop has seen\nseveral other business clients achieve $1 million in sales just\nthree months after launch. To put that time frame into\nperspective, consider that some large organizations take three\nmonths just to approve one step of a stage-gate process.\nSingularity University Labs\nA steady stream of corporate executives pass through\nSingularity University in search of their Holy Grail: any\nmechanism to manage disruptive innovation. In response, SU has\ncreated a laboratory designed to enable corporate innovation\nteams to reside full-time at SU’s open innovation campus so that\nthey can collaborate and partner with SU’s portfolio of startups\nand its faculty. Each SU startup aims to leverage accelerating\ntechnologies to positively impact a billion people. SU’s faculty\nincludes the world’s leading experts, practitioners and\nresearchers in eight accelerating technologies. Organizations\nalready on board include Coca-Cola, UNICEF, Lowe’s and\nHershey’s.A comment from a recent participant captures the essence of\nthe program: “Access to world experts in exponential\ntechnologies and organizations ensures we’re thinking beyond\nnext quarter’s earnings report—way beyond. Most of the\nCorporate Innovation Exchange members are here to drive\ndisruption within our own companies—be fore two kids in a\ngarage do it for us.”\nmach49\nYotopou los, who also created SAP’s Global Business\nIncubator, has capitalized on that unique experience, combining\nit with his decade-long background as a Silicon Valley venture\ncapitalist. He and Linda Yates, a seasoned CEO and public\nboard member with over twenty years experience driving\nstrategy and innovation in the Global 1000, are implementing\nseveral ExO principles to help global companies create new,\n“adjacent” businesses generated from within their organization.\nThey intend to offer facilities, Valley networks and a seasoned\nteam of executives familiar with both the corporate and startup\nworlds to jumpstart new corporate businesses—and to do so by\nleveraging resources that the corporation itself does not (and\nperhaps cannot) own.\nYotopou los and Yates start by leveraging the corporation’s\ncrowd in an incentive competition to see which internal\nentrepreneurs propos e the most compelling business\noppor tunities. The winning teams get all-expense-paid trips to\nmach49’s Silicon Valley facility. There, they are paired with\nnon-competitive teams from other industries. All the groups are\nthen immersed in Lean startup-style entrepreneurship and designthinking. The goal is to validate business oppor tunities through\nprototypes and in-market tests.\nAfter working alongside the mach49 team and network, these\nsmall, multi-disciplinary teams of corporate intrapreneurs leave\nwith defined, validated oppor tunities and a clear execution plan.\nThey can then stay on in Silicon Valley to accelerate, be spun\nback into (or out of) the mother ship, or serve as pilots to pave\nthe way to larger acquisitions or partnerships. While it’s early\ndays yet, we think the model holds extraordinary promise.\nH-Farm (Treviso, Italy)\nMaurizio Rossi, a seasoned entrepreneur, created H-Farm in\n2005 with Internet veteran Ricardo Donadon. Their aim was to\ncreate an atelier for “digital artisans” at a countryside facility\noutside Venice. There, in forty-two buildings dotting a former\nfarm, Rossi and Donadon run educational courses, hackathons\nand design competitions. The program has grown to house 450\nentrepreneurs and developers, and the pair hopes to double that\nnumber within two years. The majority of their teams are made\nup of entrepreneurs, but about a third are composed of corporate\naccelerators who sign on for one-year memberships.\nH-Farm also runs monthly hackathons for large companies,\nand winners are hosted onsite to build out their ideas. One\ncreative H-Farm project comes from Porsche, which invites\ncustomers to the farm for pitch sessions in which Porsche\nowners can investigate and possibly even invest in great\nstartups. Talk about the ultimate customer-purchasing bonus.The incubator operations listed above  are just a few examples of what is\nproving to be a broad trend. Similar ExO-oriented incubators are springing\nup in countries all over the world: Communitech and OneEleven in Ontario;\nSociaLab, with several offices throughout South America; Start-Up Chile, in\nSantiago; and Thinkubator, which is headquartered in Copenhagen. Google\nhas been especially busy, partnering with Startup Weekend and Women 2.0 in\nthe U.S., iHub in Kenya and Le Camping in France.\nEveris, a multinational consulting firm based in Madrid, has partnered\nwith two Spanish entrepreneurs, Luis Gonzalez-Blanch and Pablo De Manuel\nTriantafilo, to create mentoring software that matches executives in big\ncompanies with startups in their internal incubators. Everis, which intends to\noffer the service to hundreds of clients across Spain, is looking to push\nconsulting into the new economy of open-talent, accelerating innovation,\nconnected knowledge, Big Data, intelligent currency and pervasive\nentrepreneurship. In each field, a likely roadmap and database have already\nbeen created. In entrepreneurship, for example, the company has created the\nbiggest B2B ICT startup database in the world. It lists 63,000 entrepreneur\nsupport organizations, is currently trawling through the APIs of over six\nhundred websites and has analyzed ove r half a million startups and SMEs.\nEach partnership listed above  is further evidence of our belief that large\norganizations can create successful partnerships with local, grassroots\nbusiness accelerators. Business Integration Partners (BIP), a global\nconsulting firm based in Italy, even has a “Corporate Accelerator in a Box”\nservice. BIP has helped several blue-chip clients set up their own operation\nwith recruiting, VC connections and university partnerships.

        "name": "Chapter Ten: The Exponential Executive",
        "contents": "The company  was staffed with a lot of very smart people\ndrowning unde r a deluge of data—price movements, econom ic\nreleases, client data and news—far more data than any human\ncould reasonabl y consume and analyze. Andy Morton, the\ndivision’s global head and a self-described “numbers guy”\n(famous in the financ ial world as one of the three creators of\nthe Heath-Jarrow-Morton interest rate framework), had long\nbelieved that a new generation of smart algorithms could\nexpone ntially improve the produc tivity of his organization. In\n2014, he hired Arjun Viswanathan, an interest rate option\ntrader with twelve years of experience using computational\nmarket techniques, to help him realize this vision.\nViswanathan’s task was to find a way to embrace and use data\neffectively.\nViswanathan (like Morton, a mathematician/computer-\nscientist-turned-trader), had been exposed to the concept of\nExpone ntial Organizations at the 2013 Singularity Summit in\nBudape st, and wanted to implement ExO ideas internally. He\nand Morton carefully designed their experiment: Viswanathan\nwould report directly to Morton and would have access to all\nRates’ resources and data. He also had a mandat e to form\nfluid teams with other senior people within the business.\nResources would be used on demand, while applications would\nbe tested and iterated rapidly via an internal group of\nemployees. Apps would be small, intuitive, fun and visual—in\nshort, they would be designed to get information into\nemployees’ minds as quickly as possible. AI, Machine\nLearning and data analytics would be extensively used to freeup human thinking. The idea was to put the right people,\nresources and ideas together and wait for something magical\nto happe n.\nSomething did. Within just three months, the new setup\nresulted in several key problems being solved, including\npredictions concerning client behavior, market moves and\npending econom ic releases, as well as market regime\nclassification. There were also several other chunk y problems\nthat, in the old world, would have taken multi-person teams a\nyear or more to implement.\nAll issues on the table, however, were solved within weeks,\nusing one-twentieth the resources, time and cost as before—an\noutcome that would have seemed impossible as recently as\n2012. Real applications now sit on key desks, answering in\nseconds  questions that previously took days to answer—or\nsimply could not be answered at all. The apps  themselves were\nbeautiful, and e mployees were enjoying us ing them in ways not\noriginally imagined; data was once again fun. Today , this\nparadigm is catching on elsewhere within Citigroup, with\nother divisions investigating how they can kick-start similar\nchange  within their own ope rations.\nWhy did the new setup work so well for the Rates group?\nSuccess grew out of a strong c ombination of  the following:\nSuppor t for the project at the highest level. Morton is an\nintellectually curious business head willing to disrupt his\norganization.\nReliance on a coordinator with both domain and machine\nlearning expertise.A well-conne cted network of people within the business\nwho actively embrace algorithmic augm entation of\nhuman roles and ar e quick to exchange  ideas.\nAn unde rstanding and i mplementation of  ExO techniques.\nLife at C-Level\nToday, a new wave of revolutionary technologies have begun to make\ntheir mark: cheap analog sensors, Bitcoin, 3D printing, neuro-marketing, AI,\nrobotics, nanotech and Big Data. And these technologies are just the\nvanguard of an era of unprecedented innovation. Not only can they change the\nway businesses organize and operate, they must do so. Merely adopting any\nof these new technologies will force fundamental changes in how we work.\nIn particular, by their very nature, these technologies will accelerate the pace\nof the commercial world—a nd not just incrementally, but expone ntially. And\nfor all that we’ve been through over the last half-century of the technology\nrevolution, this acceleration will be unlike anything we’ve ever known\nbefore.\nIn time, we are all going to experience this astonishing new pace of\nchange…bu t no one sooner, or ultimately more, than corporate executives.\nThese so-called C-Level executives, including the CEO, CMO, CTO, CFO\netc., and the newly-emerging Chief Data Officer (CDO), are going to find\nthemselves under enormous pressure to either “go exponential”—as we’ve\nalready seen, a difficult task for any established enterprise—or deal with the\nthreat presented by new, exponential competitors. The decisions they will\nmake, often under pressure and on the fly, will likely determine not just\nwhether their companies succeed, but whether or not they survive. Onceagain, this isn’t the first time corporate executives have faced an existential\nchallenge wrought by a technological/organizational revolution, but this time\naround the window of oppor tunity will be briefer than ever before. There\nwill be no time to hesitate—much less time to ponder—be fore making major\nstrategic moves.\nFor that reason, we are dedicating this final chapter to understanding the\nExponential Executive, a new leader destined to emerge from this\ntransformed economy. And by the end of the chapter, we hope to have\nanswered the following:\nWhich technologies will have the most impact on the C-Suite?\nWhat new organizational developments must an Exponential Executive\ntrack and be ready for?\nWhat questions and issues will the ExO Executive face in the next five\nto ten years as a result of this collective and accelerating change?\nWe begin by touching on a sample of five major technologies and some\nmeta-trends that will drive change across many industries. Then we’ll\nexamine how the CEO, CMO, CTO and other executives need to deal with\nthese technologies in the very near future.\nLet’s begin with the transformative technologies (with many thanks to the\nfaculty at Singularity University, who suggested or reviewed many of the\nideas below):\nLikely Breakthrough Technologies\nSensors and the Internet of Things\nDescription: We’ll see a leap from eight billion Internet-\nconnected devices today to fifty billion by 2020.Anything and everything will have sensors embedded,\nfrom wearables and packages to even food.\nImplications: Infinite computation (as Moore’s Law\ncontinues) and infinite storage, both essentially free; the\nQuantified Employee; AaaS (Analytics as a Service);\nhardware as the new software via developments such as\nArduino; new business models based on connected\nproducts.\nAI, data science and analytics\nDescription: Ubiquitous usage of Machine Learning and\nDeep Learning algorithms to process vast caches of\ninformation.\nImplications: Algorithms driving more and more business\ndecisions; AIs replacing a large percentage of\nknowledge workers; AIs looking for patterns in\norganizational data; algorithms embedded into products.\nVirtual/augmented reality\nDescription: Avatar-quality VR available on desktop in 2-3\nyears. Oculus Rift, High Fidelity and Google Glass drive\nnew applications.\nImplications: Remote viewing; centrally located experts\nserving more areas; new practice areas; remote\nmedicine.\nBitcoin and block chain\nDescription: Trustless, ultra-low-cost secure transactions\nenabled by distributed ledgers that log everything.Implications: The blockchain becomes a trust engine; most\nthird-party validation functions become automated (e.g.,\nmulti-signatory contracts, voting systems, audit\npractices). Micro-transactions and new payment systems\nbecome ubiquitous.\nNeuro-feedbac k\nDescription: Use of feedback loops  to bring the brain to a\nhigh level of precision.\nImplications: Capacity to test and deploy entirely new\nclasses of applications (e.g., focus@will); group\ncreativity apps; flow hacking; therapeutic aids, stress\nreduction and sleep improvement.\nThese new technologies will, in turn, underpin the appearance of five\nlikely meta-trends:\nPerfect knowledge\nImplications: With the Internet of (Every)thing, sensors,\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems and unlimited\nsensors, users will be able to know anything they want,\nanywhere and at any time.\nVirtual worlds\nImplications: Philip Rosedale notes that Hollywood\nspecial effects migrate to the desktop after five years.\nAvatar is now three years old and will soon be available\non the Oculus Rift. Almost perfect VR is around the\ncorner, and will deliver experiential reality andtransform retail, travel, and living and working\nenvironments.\n3D printing\nImplications: 3D printing (and soon 4D) will not radically\nchange big manufacturing, but it will enable an entirely\nnew class of products that will displace traditional\nmanufacturing. A Kinko’s model of local 3D printing of\nvirtually anything will appear shortly and the technology\nwill have a major impact on warehousing and\ntransportation. U.S. manufacturing will be revitalized as\nrecent offshoring trends reverse.\nDisruption of payment systems\nImplications: In 2012, Visa and MasterCard credit card\npurchases totaled more than $1.5 trillion in the U.S.\nalone. Payment systems and money transfer mechanisms\nhaven’t changed for decades, but with Square, PayPal\nand now Clinkle and Bitcoin, this domain is ready for a\nmajor transformation. One form will come via\nmobile/social wallets and seamless transactions. A\nsecond will come via micropayments (probably via the\nblock chain). The ability to move infinitesimal\ntransaction amounts will underpin entirely new business\nmodels.\nAutonomous vehicles\nImplications: In September 2014, California will issue the\nfirst license plates for driverless cars. Starting withdelivery vehicles and then taxis, predictions call for\nexisting road capacity to increase 8-10 times once a\ncritical mass of AVs is reached. Ridesharing is an\nintermediate step toward fully automated transportation,\nwhich may have a bigger visible impact on society than\nanything else, including sustainability, urban planning\n(almost no parking lots) and fewer traffic fatalities.\nNote that most of these technologies and trends were unknown a decade\nago, and all were non-existent thirty years ago. No doubt even more\ntechnologies and trends, as yet unknown, will emerge in even the next five\nyears as convergences and intersection points drive an ever-faster pace of\nchange. For five decades, predictions around Moore’s Law have promised\nacceleration, and we are now seeing what that really means.\nIt is important to stress that the two lists above  represent just a small\nsample of what is racing our way. It’s also worth revisiting the findings of the\nInnovation Partners Program survey, detailed in Chapter Eight, of the eighty\nFortune 500 C -Level executives:\nBefore the event, 75 percent of the C-Level attendees had little or no\nawareness of accelerating technologies.\nAfter the program, 80 percent of the attendees agreed that the\ntechnologies and strategies would have a “game-changing impact” on\ntheir industries within two years, and all agreed that the impact would\noccur within five years.\nAll of the executives—100 percent of them—had a list of urgent-action\nitems upon returning to their offices.\nNote that second statistic. 80 percent of Fortune 500 CxOs agreed that\ntheir industries would experience game-changing transformations due to",

        "name": "Epilogue: A New Cambrian Explosion",
        "contents": "innovator Nilofer Merchant calls them “800-ounce gorillas.” Leveraging\nSCALE elements allows ExOs to extend themselves beyond traditional\nboundaries, and the IDEAS elements help retain control and some semblance\nof order. In fact, we are seeing a fascinating development in companies like\nAmazon, Facebook  and Google who have full implementation of the IDEAS\nelements: they become depoliticized. By making data-driven, objective\ndecisions (Experimentation), self-directed teams (Autonomy), constant shared\nawareness (Social) and Dashboards, teams focus on the end result rather than\ninternal politics.\nAnd for existing organizations, the Chapter Ten example of Arjun\nViswanathan at Citigroup shows how dramatically you can make an impact by\napplying ExO thinking into an existing organization. Ian Chan, a partner at\nDeloitte Canada whose enviable title is “Disruption Leader”, has already\nformed a team to implement ExO principles for their clients.\nTheir extreme performance and scalability comes as a result of either\ndominating new markets with information services, or attacking existing ones\nby dropping the cost of supply and virtually taking out the denominator in the\nrevenue/cost equation.\nHere’s another tangible example: In 1979 General Motors employed\n840,000 employees and generated $11 billion in earnings (in 2012 dollars).\nNow, let’s compare GM to Google, which in 2012 employed 38,000 (less\nthan 5 percent of GM’s 1979 workforce) and generated $14 billion in\nearnings (120 percent of GM’s). What a difference an information-based\nenvironment can make! In fact, the recent book  by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan\nRosenberg, How Google Works, maps almost completely to our IDEAS\nelements.\nSo, now that we know ExOs are here to stay, here are a few new questions\nto think about: How far into the general economy will ExOs penetrate? How\nmany industries and markets will they upend? How many established and(currently) successful companies will disappear in the face of exponential\ncompetitors? And finally, how would an ExO economy change the way we\nlive and work?\nIn addition to the extraordinary financial progress achieved by the\norganizations listed above , we have also tracked their organizational progress\nas they systematically implemented each of the ExO elements (MTP, SCALE\nand IDEAS). (And we’ll continue to track their evolution at\nwww.exponentialorgs.com.) Along the way, we’ve come to appreciate that\nthe best analogy for an ExO is the Internet itself. The Internet is a distributed,\ndecentralized architecture, with open standards and innovation occurring at\nthe edges. Startups with ExO attributes mirror that same set of characteristics.\nAfter twenty years of being the edge of innovation, the Internet is now the\nfoundation of almost all innovation. As enterprises grow more exponential, it\nis our belief that they will become distributed, decentralized platforms\nleveraging communities with open APIs. We also believe they will operate\nwith a balanced mix of open and protected data, encouraging constant and\ndisruptive innovation at their edges.\nIn the same way that Internet communications have seen costs drop to near\nzero, we expect to see internal organizational and transactions costs also fall\nto near zero as we increasingly information-enable and distribute our\norganizational structures. Ultimately, in the face of such low transaction costs,\nwe anticipate what we’re calling a Cambrian Explosion in organizational\ndesign—everything from community-based structures to virtual organizations\n(see Ethereum) that will be small, nimble and extensible.\nIt is also becoming increasingly clear that, like the Internet, the ExO\nparadigm is not just for business. It can just as easily be applied to all sorts of\nenterprises and organizations, from academia to non-profits to government. In\nshort, it is not just a system of commerce, but also a philosophy  of action.For example, what would an exponential government look like?\nEntrepreneur and technology strategist Andrew Rasiej believes governments\nshould be platforms for civic engagement. Jerry Michalski, founder of the\nRelationship Expedition (REX), notes that the true task of government should\nbe to manage the commons—the cultural and natural resources that belong to\nall members of a society—a system more effectively handled by MTP-driven\ncommunities than by elected, corruptible officials with often-suspect motives.\nFrankly, from the right perspective, traditional representative government\ncan be seen as just a rudimentary version of an ExO. That is, it has an MTP\n(its country or region), leverages community and crowd (tax collection as\ncoerced crowdfunding), is decentralized, gathers and leverages data and\ninsights, puts the community first (in theory), leverages engagement (civics\nand elections), and has extensive assets (public lands) and staff on demand\n(the armed forces and reserves).\nSo the real question is not whether governments can become ExOs—in a\ncrude way, they already are—bu t whether or not they are able to fulfill their\ndestiny to be true, fully functional, technology driven, high-performance\nmodern ExOs. In fact, here’s what we really should be asking ourselves: What\nwould such a government look like?\nThe opportunity for governments to fulfill that destiny certainly exists. In\nfact, a couple of ExO-style governmental systems have already been realized.\nThe protection of the Lesser Prairie Chicken, an endangered species in the\nSouthern Great Plains of the U.S., has ironically had a negative effect on\nanyone trying to erect a wind turbine in the region. The process to assess\nhabitat impact was taking over six months. Each aspect of an assessment\nrequired approval at every step. Finally, a group of agencies, including\nWildlife & Parks, created a GIS system that encoded all the sensitive areas.\nNow, the system approves a new location instantly and offers alternatives ifthere’s a problem. That’s an almost millionfold improvement in elapsed time,\nand all with minimal effort.\nSuccessful implementation of ExO strategies within a governmental\norganization can also be found in the UK. Mike Bracken, head of the\nGovernment Digital Service, runs his department as if it were an ExO.\nConstant experimentation with users, fast iterations, citizen-centered design\nand the use of GitHub repositories have resulted in a 90 percent approval\nrating for the department’s latest app. (When was the last time any government\nservice saw approval numbers like that?)\nAside from government, we believe ExO principles will transform other\nsiloed areas as well. Take scientific research, which, bizarrely, is still\nfiercely attached to the “publish or perish” mantra.\n“A strong publishing record is key to getting grant funding,” says Sarah\nSclarsic, a biotech executive with Modern Meadow who has been researching\nthis issue. The problem, however, is that top scientific journals favor\nsensational studies with positive-correlation findings. As a result, she says,\nscientists feel pressure to produce those sensational outcomes, regardless of\nwhether or not the science is sound. Sclarsic notes that when researchers at\nAmgen recently tried to reproduce the results of fifty-three landmark cancer\npapers, they were only able to substantiate six (11 percent). “This\n[publishing] bias undermines the open inquiry and objectivity that lie at the\nheart of science, and which is critical for the discipline’s success.”\nThankfully, new initiatives like figshare and the Public Library of Science\n(PLOS) are breaking down this archaic structure. Researchgate, an ExO, is an\nopen, community-based website where researchers can publish all results—\nand scientists and researchers are flocking to the site in droves. Now over\nfive million strong, the ResearchGate community alone might well multiply\nscientific and technological progress by orders of magnitude.Jobs and The Economy\nOther, equally important questions to contemplate as we move into an ExO\nenvironment: What kind of economy would an ExO world produce? What\nhappens as we information-enable more and more processes and products?\nPaint a picture of an information-enabled world and you’re liable to elicit\na typically dystopian scenario: robots and other forms of artificial intelligence\nobviate the need for our jobs and we collapse into crisis and social chaos.\nThe effect of technology on the economy is hardly a new conversation. The\nMcCormick reaper in the 1870s , the assembly line in the early twentieth\ncentury, the computer in the 1950s —we’ve heard it all before. Marc\nAndreessen has pointed out that the robots-will-take-our-jobs argument first\ntook place in 1964, relying on the exact same terminology and engendering the\nsame fears we’re seeing in the press today. In a recent discussion with Salim,\nnoted economist John Mauldin said he stands with Andreessen in not\nbelieving in a zero sum game. Instead, he holds that the economy will simply\nexpand to include new activities that could never have been imagined before.\n(That said, Mauldin also believes there are two oppos ing tensions at play in\nthe bigger economics picture, at least in the short term: governments making\nunsustainable promises regarding pensions, healthcare, etc., and increasing\nproductivity as a result of technology.)\nMauldin has criticized economists for their tendency to assess the\neconomy based on an assumption of equilibrium, pointing out that they almost\nnever realize that the information revolution inevitably disrupts this\nequilibrium. As W. Brian Arthur recently said: “Complexity economics is a\ndifferent way of thinking about the economy. It sees the economy not as a\nsystem in equilibrium but as one in motion, perpetually ‘computing’ itself—\nperpetually constructing itself anew. Where equilibrium economics\nemphasizes order, determinacy, deduction and stasis, this new frameworkemphasizes contingency, indeterminacy, sense-making and ope nness to change.\nUntil now, economics has been a noun-based rather than verb-based science.”\nWe believe very much in the optimistic Andreessen/Mauldin worldview.\nFor example, in 1980, only ninety-two craft brewers existed across the U.S.\nWhen our co-author Mike Malone’s father was writing about the beer industry\nin the 1980s , these “hobby ” breweries were considered little more than\nnovelties, unable to maintain consistent quality and targeted to a niche\naudience. Then, as technology drove costs lower, making the industry\naccessible to anyone and everyone, hobby ists and small brewers suddenly\nfound themselves in a position to run increasingly sophisticated, high quality\nmicrobreweries. Today there are almost 3,000 m icrobreweries in the U.S., the\nmost in over a century. Among them, they have created 110,000 jobs across\nthe country.\nBut that’s not all. A 2010 study conducted by the Kauffman Foundation\nfound that over the past forty years, big companies have created zero new net\njobs. Instead, 100 percent of new job creation has come via startups and\nentrepreneurs. After tracking the popu lar Maker Movement, pioneered by\nDale Dougherty, The Grommet uncovered similar results, reporting that small\nbusinesses have created eight million new jobs since 1990, while large ones\nhave eliminated four million positions.\nAs we mentioned in Chapter Five, the democratization of technology\nallows individuals and small teams to follow their passions, be it drones,\nDNA synthesis or beer. We believe MTP communities leveraging accelerating\ntechnologies could dramatically create new economic oppor tunities, and we\nexpect to see an abundance of new occupations in the near future—albeit very\ndifferent from the kind of work we’re doing today. The question we may soon\nask one another is, “How do you occupy yourself?” rather than, “What’s your\njob?” Bottom line: the Cambrian Explosion is already underway.From Scarcity to Abundance\nFuturist Paul Saffo has noted that humanity started out as a producer\neconomy, transformed into a consumer economy and is now moving towards\nbecoming a creator economy. Over the centuries, money and commerce have\nbeen the main modes of discourse around the world. Today, however,\ninformation is rapidly supplanting money to become the main mode of\ndiscourse (note that information is already largely fungible). Perhaps the\neasiest way of framing this macro shift is as a move from scarcity to\nabundance. Jerry Michalski notes that in the past, scarcity meant value. That\nis, without scarcity, you didn’t have a business. Now that notion has been\nupended. Dave Blakely of IDEO thinks about ExOs in the following way:\n“These new organizations are exponential because they took something scarce\nand made it abundant.” Nokia bought Navteq, trying to buy, own and control\nscarcity, only to be leapfrogged by Waze, which managed to harness\nabundance.\nBasically, Exponential Organizations are about managing abundance, and\nan information-based world drives us towards that abundance. (As outlined\nearlier, Steven Kotler and Peter Diamandis’ book  Abundanc e demonstrates\nthe likelihood of  this outcome.)\nThus, the triumph of the Exponential Organization begins to look\ninevitable. In his 2014 book  The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet\nof Things, the Collabor ative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism,\nJeremy Rifkin presents a central thesis that strongly correlates with our\n“Drive to Demonetization” notion, presented in Chapter Five, in which we\npoint out that ExOs push marginal costs to near zero. Rifkin, however, makes\na much bigger point. He believes that what we’re seeing is a new economic\nsystem emerging for the first time since the rise of capitalism, a new world ofvery low or zero marginal costs, one that he refers to as the Collaborative\nCommons.\nAs you can imagine, this new economic system represents an enormous\nthreat to capitalism. Ironically, the very rise and ascendance of capitalism (to\nmake goods and services ever cheaper) has been so successful that, Rifkin\nbelieves, it will ultimately eat its creator, thereby destroying capitalism itself.\nThe key driver for this dynamic? Goods  and services being information-\nenabled on a global scale.\nOnly time will tell if Rifkin is correct, or at least partially correct, as this\nnew paradigm comes to dominate large sectors of modern life. But what is\ncertain is that Exponential Organizations are the key to managing the new age\nof the Collaborative Commons and the economies of Abundance.\nUnfortunately, and ironically, there is a scarcity of guidance for this new\nparadigm. Almost every business school case study today is now out of date,\nsince each teaches (abundantly) how to optimize and manage scarcity.\nCorrespondingly, most management practices, which predominantly focus on\nscaling efficiency, are also out of date. There is no MBA course that\ndemonstrates Interfaces and no management consultant who can advise Uber\nabout implementing algorithms.\nWe’ve noted that when ExOs get big, they become platforms that spawn\nother, smaller ExOs, much like a healthy and growing coral reef spawns all\nnumber of interesting creatures at its outer fringes. As industries become\nincreasingly information-enabled, we believe they will inevitably consolidate\nto a few big platforms per industry, each hosting a multitude of small ExOs at\ntheir vents and fissures.\nHowever all this plays out, one thing, we hope, is clear. The Exponential\nOrganization is the future for any enterprise with a strong information\ncomponent—which is, of course, every enterprise. You can enter this new\nworld now or later. But, in the end, you will enter it.Your responsibility to your employees, investors and customers demands\nthat you not wait. The instant a part of your business or industry is\ninformation-enabled, marginal costs will start to disappear and your\norganization will either take on ExO dynamics or disappear. Hesitate too long\nand you may soon watch your competitors accelerate away, leaving your\ncompany a mere footnote in their corporate histories.\nThere is no need, however, to end up a historical footnote. Think again\nabout the many examples of how exponential thinking and action have not only\nenabled disruptive new companies, but also driven stunning progress and\nchange in all kinds and sizes of organizations. You now have the instruction\nmanual for recreating yourself as an Exponential Organization. We invite you\nto start dow n that path today.\nSalim Ismail\nMike Malone\nYuri van Geest\nAs is clear from our “Top ExOs” chart at the beginning of  the Epilogue ,\nExO attributes are evolving qui ckly. If you ar e interested in staying current\non ne ws, tips and t ricks, and c ase studies, please join us at\nwww.exponentialorgs.com.Afterword\nSo there you have it, the blueprint for building an Exponential Organization.\nWhether you’re a three-person company, or a 30,000 person company,\nreinventing your company around the intrinsic and extrinsic attributes\nidentified in this book  are critical.\nWe can all point at companies we think of as linear (say GM) and\ncompanies we think of as exponential (say Google), but now we can actually\nmeasure that difference and know how and why they operate at a 25-fold\nperformance differential in revenue per employee, as Salim points out in the\nepilogue. Part of that 25x difference comes from the productivity tools (i.e.\nexponential technologies) now available. And granted they operate in\ndifferent industries, but it indicates directionally the broad shift from a\nmaterial-based world to an information-based one.\nWe have arrived at this perspective from our experiences at Singularity\nUniversity, where for the last six years, we’ve been learning from the top\nthought leaders, researchers and practitioners in accelerating technologies.\nWhat’s critical to note however, is that we literally are still at the very\nbeginning of the coming age of disruptive technologies. We haven’t seen\nanything yet. In the next decade or two, these accelerating tools will continue\nto grow in utility, and winner-take-all network effects will accelerate\nExponential Organizations to record heights.\nThe reality is that during this time of exponential change you must evolve\nyour company—you are either disrupting yourself or someone else is—\nsitting still equals death.",
